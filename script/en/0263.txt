Such Sion truly exists?<>

It was a unique kind that have not yet seen.<>

Sion, a runed amulet, has never been scientifically
categorized.  There are too many combinations of
Carta inside Sion to classify them.<>

I'm afraid that we could not bring the Sion with us,
because it's been shattered.  Felicia seemed to know
that the accident was caused by a reaction to the
Sion amulet.<>

Is that so... If Felicia knew, that could  only
mean that Vermillion has a keen knowledge of Sion.<>

We were surprised by the accident.  Though it's too
bad that it shattered, we know new properties of Sion.<>

Just as suspected, the Ancients held an awesome power
we aren't even capable of imagining...  If such Sion
can last all these years, it could only mean that
there are still greater powers.<>

If such Sion came to me...<>
