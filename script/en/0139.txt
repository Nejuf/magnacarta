My, how honored we are, to be personally acknowledged$nby dogs of the Imperial family.<>

Dogs of the Imperial family?<>

You mean you're not?$nYou kill off whoever the Imperial Family tells you.<>

If your impudence had kept you silent,$nthere would be no punishment.$nYou start annoying us though,$nand we have to set things back to how they should be.<>

Hmph. Funny to hear you say that,$nbecause you're all scum.$nYou don't even have permission$nto move without the Emperor.<>

You make your living by mugging others,$nand you think you're an authority on the matter?<>
