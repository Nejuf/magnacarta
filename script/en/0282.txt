Captain Calintz, I clearly ordered you to have this
area barricaded and closed off.  Yet you went against
my order.  You should know that I am to direct the
Schwartz on this mission.  The Commander General 
does not have authority.<>

So, are you saying that we don't have a duty to guard
peasants if they are too poor to pay taxes?
Would you have closed the area in Shudelmir? Well?<>

Evell is your hometown.  I know this well,
and I give my condolences to your late family.  
However... you are to carry out your duties as
required by the military.  Your judgment needs 
to be more reasonable, Soldier.<>

Wilhelmina... if it was my brother,
the area would never have been blocked off.<>

I've considered the situation carefully,
and made the best decision based on the circumstances.<>

Abandoning civilians is the best decision?<>

Enough, Chelsea.  Wilhelmina, this incident
is my fault.  I will take whatever punishment
is appropriate for not supervising my men properly.<>

Why is your dumb ass begging? Wilhelmina's retarded
thinking cost Evell lives! Aren't we supposed to SAVE
as many lives as possible? As a soldier, I was taught
to save lives even if it meant your own life was
endangered in the process!<>

Roffma, you wouldn't have been so angry
if you weren't from this area.<>

What was that?<>

I am the Supreme Commander at this time.
Withdraw immediately, this is an order.
The Commander General will assign appropriate
disciplinary action at the base.<>
