Central Roendriger Island - Near Sihara Grasslands<>

Let's not stray too far from Shudelmir.<>

Have you heard of ESTi?
Rumor has it he's the biggest pimp around Shudelmir.<>

They say he's got his own Harem or "Love Mansion."
Must be great.  Something a poor guy like myself
can't even dream of.<>

Although, it makes me pretty angry... hmph.<>

Anyways, the place is perfect for hunting,
the scenary's great too.  Every year, His Majesty
holds tournaments.  On the day of the tournament,
the one who brings the best looking fox hides wins.<>

I'm practicing myself to get a head start.
When it comes to hunting, it doesn't matter
whether you're a nobleman or a regular guy.
Why don't you try it out?<>

If I can find some decent fox hides,
I'll have a year of free money for food,
amongst other things, heh.<>
