Joker escaped...$nCalintz, have you been guarding him at all?<>

Hm...<>

I have a feeling that you let him go.<>

That fool brought Felicia to us.$nShouldn't there have been a token of appreciation?<>

You might just be the first I've$ncome across who has no regard for martial law.<>

I'll honor your discharge notice anytime.<>

That attitude keeps you here.<>

Sirat courts didn't welcome me either,$nbut Helios insisted I stay.<>

Well, someone completely unrelated$nmoved here in the end...<>

Joker has no place to go.$nWill Scaramouche receive a traitor?<>

It's not my concern, since he ran off on his own.<>

Can you at least take care of your unit?<>

It's not my job to babysit.<>

Touche.<>
