Missing in action...$ndoes that mean he's gone forever?<>

I was still young when I was chosen to be married$nto the Prince of Krois. No other reason than$nthe fact that I was the first-born child of Sirat's Royal Family.$nI was part of the weaker country, so I had to marry him.$nAs I stepped into such an unfamiliar environment,$nI was scared. I could not see anything$neven after arriving at Krois.$nHowever, Prince Rowellron was a kind and warm man,$nunlike what I had imagined.$nEven if it was an arranged marriage,$nI was sure that we were in love.$nI thought that my future days would continue to be happy.<>

If that really was so,$nI wouldn't have become an Orakhan and$nI wouldn't be a lowly woman$nwho only thinks of gaining power.<>

No! Give him back to me! My baby, my baby!<>

Aaahh......<>

No longer is he near me, my child.$nThere is no way I can find him, either.$nAt this point...$nwhat good would it do even if I did find him?<>
