Calintz...!<>

Calintz......?<>

Unwetter......!?<>

It's too late...Calintz is no more.<>

What......?<>

Calintz is dead, within me. He dared to accuse me of killing his father, yet in truth it was he who murdered his father. In the end, that helped me take over..<>

What are you talking about? Are you......?<>

That's... Calintz's...<>

Unwetter, how are you...!<>

Mephisto, you've been hard at work. Well done. The time I've been waiting for has finally come. The night of Magna Carta... has begun.<>

...Return Calintz, give him back to me!<>

It's too late.<>

...No.<>

I thank you as well. All of the so-called purifications, transferring Carta... your weapons should now carry an awesome amount of power!<>

......!<>

What...?<>

Magna Carta requires the power of the Ancients. Such powers that your weapons have become attuned to after absorbing great quantities of Carta. You've all been used. Do you think it was an accident that Felicia, Joker, and Rose all joined Squad Seven?<>

......What?<>

Joker, of course you think you made sharp moves, but who do you think gave you chances to get Felicia, to destroy Scaramouche so you would have no place to return to? Who do you think let Schwartz take Rose?  Do you understand now?<>

Unwetter, you......!<>

Now, I shall reap your Carta. Thank you for your contributions towards Magna Carta.<>

You son-of-a-bitch! You toyed with us! Do you think we'll just hand over our weapons?<>

You simply cannot stand against me.<>

Then... let's have it!<>

......Unwetter, you deceived us. For what? You are the leader of Vermillion.<>

No... I'm not Unwetter Ropeidon. I'm just Tristan. A replica of Unwetter made of twisted images...huhuhu<>
