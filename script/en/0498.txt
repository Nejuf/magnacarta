Let's not go out too far.<>

Haa... thought I'd die.$nRoendri Island has great scenery,$nbut it's not a safe place to wander around.<>

I was almost done for,$nbut some guy named Tian saved me from the monsters.$nYou know about the guy?$nHe's a famous hunter around here.<>

He's won a few hunting tournaments too...$nEvery time Tian appears there's something to gossip about.<>

You, interested in the way?<>

You have a sharp look in your eyes,$nI can tell just by looking at them.$nMysterious and heavenly power rests in your eyes.$nDo you understand? The spirit of the heavens.<>
