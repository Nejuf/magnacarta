Unwetter...<>

Don't be too disappointed.$nScaramouche will not be left alone,$nespecially after this case.$nI suppose notable results will be$nacceptable during a retaliation attack.<>

Of course... that is my intent.$nHowever, what difference would it make to$nattack Scaramouche when Felicia is within Schwartz?<>

Scaramouche is corrupt and already facing its end.$nThey have been troublesome to us.$nThis is a path we can take to eliminate them.<>

It... shall be done, Unwetter.<>
