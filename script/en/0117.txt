Wait...<>

What's the matter?<>

We're running in circles.<>

I thought this place seemed odd.$nNot to mention this weird fog.<>

I see... This is a mirage.<>

A mirage?<>

This is a trick used with batches of Carta,$naligned improperly on purpose,$nto close one road in a circle or to connect$ncompletely different roads together.$nThe fog is there so no one would notice the trick.<>

Well, how do we get through?<>

Somewhere in the forest there must be a seal.$nIf we destroy the seal the rune used for the magic$nwill be cleared and we'll find the correct road.$nIf they know how to use mirages properly,$nwe're facing highly intelligent enemies.<>

Cool, you're so knowledgeable.<>

We're going to live thanks to that.$nNow stop acting like a brat.<>

Yeah, I know. Shut up.<>
