I'll be off then.<>

You always show up out of nowhere$nand then leave so suddenly...$nSo where do you live?<>

Uhm... That's a secret.$nBut I'm not with weirdos like Vermillion,$nso don't think of me like that.$nI'm just... Uhm, I can't tell. I'm leaving.<>

...<>

That kid, are you gonna leave her like that?$nOr are you onto her already? She looks pure,$nbut we really don't know that much about her.<>

I don't think she's that problematic.<>

Haha, maybe the kid's playing a$nstalker because she loves you so much.<>

...<>

I have a gut feeling that I'll somehow regret it...$nIf I find out who Adora really is.$nI just felt that she'd disappear. Just like Estell...<>

There really are a lot of questions concerning Adora.$nMaybe I better start researching her.$nEven though my senses tell me to do so,$nI can't bring myself to do it.<>
