Did you hear?<>

What?<>

Calintz, that idiot, is going back to Sirat. By himself!<>

Alone? That's too much.<>

Well... He's going to be suffering, too. <>

You're still sitting there, you lazy ass.<>

You're here...<>

Is your body getting better?<>

Mm-hmm... Mother cares after me.<>

(I wonder how Calintz felt about the matter. When he found out that the person he hated, the person who wanted him to die, was actually connected to him by blood, and as mother and son no less...... Of course, at first the two had such an awkward relationship that they couldn't even talk to each other. However, as Ladrinne admitted her fault in front of Calintz, they were able to talk a lot, and melt the icy walls between them.)<>

I see you're calling her your Mother now...<>

......I'm only calling her my mother because she is.<>

That's true...<>

Adora hasn't changed at all, right?<>

......<>

Hey... is that really Adora?<>

Oh... You haven't seen her since that time. I forgot.<>

Well, that's Adora. But she's changed, completely...<>

(That day... Adora destroyed Calintz's Emblem. As a result, Tristan disappeared and only the current Calintz remained. However Adora somehow lost all of her memories, and her mental age even regressed. According to brother, that is true appearance of Adora: a mind wiped of all memories since childhood. No memories from the moment she was forced to wear Juclesia's pendant.  The real Adora had been living on in the memories of other people, like Calintz.)<>

(That look, though... no one could understand it. How could she have turned out to be so odd looking?)<>

What made her... change? That's not how Adora was like before?<>

......I don't understand myself. It may have been the damn Emblem.<>

Something affected her as the Emblem was destroyed?<>

You said you were going back to Sirat? I heard you were.<>

Yes...<>

What about Adora? You're going to be so irresponsible and just leave her?<>

......<>

No matter how much she's changed, Adora is still Adora. Who the hell did you like, Adora or Estell? <>

I don't know. The Adora I knew was created by the reflection of my memories of Estell... but she wasn't just Estell... At least, that's what I believed... but in the end it all crumbled away. Her roots were Estell, but it was definitely Adora that grew on top of that... and if the roots were taken, the stem and leaves would all die. <>

Now...... there is no Adora... anywhere.<>

......<>

(Calintz spoke without any spirit in his voice...) <>

Let's go back, Adora.<>

(Does appearance and memories alone make a person? Such thoughts just wouldn't leave my head.) <>

(As the Emblem broke, so did the Adora I knew. She lost both her appearance and her memories.) <>

......Adora, are you fine with me leaving? I won't leave if you don't want me to. Just say the word...<>

Will you not play with Adora today?<>

......Adora, I...<>

(The only thing that remained in her mind was her own name. Could that have been the last memory she wanted to keep?) <>

(I didn't know how to accept this person, who is no longer Adora.)<>

You're no fun. I like Joker more. 'Cause he plays with Adora often.<>

(No... I couldn't look at her. How could she have become Estell...?) <>

(Who is she now, this person made up of the Estell I miss and the vanished memories of Adora?)<>

(I failed to protect her both times. She's the result of my faults. I'll carry this guilt the rest of my life.)<>

......okay. Sorry. I won't be able to see you in the future, so I'll spend all day with you.<>

(I was hoping you'd talk to me like before... I wished you would come back as the Adora from that day.)<>

<>
