You're that Calintz guy, right?<>

(Who's this guy?)<>

You're speaking rather rashly to
someone you don't even know.<>

Who cares?  You're another one of those peasants
from Sirat. You might be good with swords but
you certainly aren't a qualified leader.<>

Commander Loclei, you're being rather harsh.
He is the seventh squad commander.<>

Hmph, what squad?  A squad full of peasants?
He's not a noble, he's just some adopted kid.<>

What do you mean by that?  I'm the step-daughter
of the Descralda family you know.<>

Ah, I'm not talking about you.<>

Stop being an annoying bastard and leave fatass!<>

Wha, what?  You insolent little...
Who do you think I am!?<>

Roffma, what do you think you're doing,
talking to a noble like that?
It's hardly surprising that he treats
you like scum when you act like that.<>

Peasant, noble, it's all the same in Schwartz.
Only difference is commander and subordinate.
What does birth have to do with it?
In this place, fighting skill is what counts.<>

How much talent can a person with no discipline have?
Those people just keep fighting recklessly.<>

What's worse is that they don't even realize it.<>

Still Loclei, don't be so cocky about your status.
It doesn't look good to the other nobles.<>

Yes... yes sir.<>

If you'll excuse us.<>

Hmph.  Corrupt bastards.<>

That's how the seventh squad is viewed.<>

You guys are the same though.
Crying about being demoted, that you can't go on
living your once luxurious life. All the same.<>

Not much I can do about my status.
I didn't become a noble because I wanted to.
I was just a little luckier than you.<>

What?<>

Stop it Roffma.  
You cause another fight and you'll get kicked out.
My brother can't save you and 
Calintz isn't terribly forgiving.<>

Hmph...<>
