Sion, the means of holding Carta...
Until now, digging them up from the ancient
ruins was the only means of acquiring them.
We couldn't create Sion ourselves, because
we didn't know how apply Runes to tools or
weapons directly. However, if we discover a 
method for doing so, it will be a big breakthrough.<>

You want to recreate old folklore? The one about
a Hero's weapon itself becoming a sacred Sion...?<>

It's not an impossible myth or some old lie. If Carta
is inscribed onto a weapon, the weapon's ability
changes. It goes without saying that the wrong
combination produces little more than scrap metal.
At the same time, inscribing can also create a Sion
of entirely new power.<>

I imagine it won't be as easy as you say.
It's hard to get powerful Carta, and we still
don't know the method for inscribing Carta.<>

We're still doing research, and we'll find the
truth someday. With powerful Sion, our efforts 
will be greatly aided. Not only that, but we're 
sure that we'll discover more about the
Rune Stones and Sion Channelers as well.<>

I suppose...<>

Your face is getting quite thin. Is your son well?<>

He seems lonely without his mom...
I don't have the time to be with him, on top of that.
Poor kid, being born in times like these. In the old
days, he would have been raised in the castle with
everyone's blessings.<>
