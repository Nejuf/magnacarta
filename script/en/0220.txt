Is that the truth?<>

Yes Joker.  On that day, despite assuming
that he would stay underground, he apparently
returned to Scaramouche.  Scaramouche was attacked
by Vermillion, perhaps as a result of Felicia.
Scaramouche is currently on the defense.<>

The death penalty eh...?  
That kind of talent is too good to waste.<>

In that case, this situation bodes well for us.
Joker can't go back to Scaramouche.  If he stays in
Schwartz, it will aid Felicia as well.<>

Do you honestly think Joker will support Felicia?<>

Your guess is as good as mine.
However, we need Felicia to be more sociable for
the sake of our research on Rune Masters.  We will
be able to deploy Rune Masters ourselves, once we
learn exactly how they function.<>

We'll watch things unfold.  I don't believe Joker
is the kind of man who dies easily.  Perhaps he
returned to Scaramouche out of guilt.<>

Scaramouche treated Joker as a traitor and jailed him.
According to our intelligence, he can be killed
in accordance with Scaramouche law.<>

Calintz reported that while Felicia is quiet
most of the time, she sometimes says interesting
things.  It seems as though she is unaware of
the friendship shared between herself and Joker,
although she reacted upon encountering him.<>
