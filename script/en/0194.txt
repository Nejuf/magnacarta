I am honored to greet your highness.<>

It's been a while, Calintz.$nI suppose this is the first time$nwe've met since that day.<>

You are correct, your highness.<>

I thank you for coming today to escort me.$nI am quite surprised to be guarded by$nSchwartz's lowest ranking members.$nOf course, thanks to the amazing luck you have,$nyou earned the trust of his highness...<>

Pardon me your highness, but Squad Seven$nis used to assignments that test physical limits.$nOf course your highness may feel that we are worthless,$nbut we may be more useful than the other guards here.<>

Quite worthy of General Gilbert's sister.$nThey say you were a commoner originally...<>

...<>

Would you wish Schwartz be$ncomprised completely of noblemen, your highness?<>

No, for Schwartz it does not matter who the members are.<>

So you were here, your highness.<>

I give you my thanks for inviting me today, Orakhan.<>

The honor is mine, your highness.$nCalintz, you will make sure that$nhis highness is guarded with utmost care.<>

I will do so, Orakhan.<>

Don't indulge yourself just because$nhis highness trusts you.$nYou all know your place, I assume.<>

I know without your reminders...<>

How is Mephisto?<>

He is keeping a constant watch among the guards.<>

However things turn out,$nfor now let's keep watching.$nRose will likely start moving soon.<>
