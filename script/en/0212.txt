It's been a while since I found someone at my level.<>

I feel the same.<>

I'm surprised that someone like you rots in Vermillion.<>

My plan was to capture you alive...$nbut you are better dead for the sake of the future.<>

...?<>

...!!<>

Rose...?<>

How dare you interfere.<>

What do you mean, interfere?$nThat's not the thing to say when you're$nout of breath like this.$nAre you going to keep fighting with wounds like that?<>

Move aside...<>

Hoo, you have no chance$nof winning in your condition now.$nGood then, I have lots of things which I owe you.<>

The Royals, where are they?<>

Interruption is it? At times like these...<>

Damn.<>

His highness... where is he? You, have you not seen him?<>

Wasn't it you who evacuated him? Dammit...<>

You, you're losing too much blood...<>

Mephisto...<>

It's been a while since I've faced someone so strong.$nI was under the impression that Vermillion$nwas just a bunch of amateurs, but this is unexpected.$nIt was as if I was hit from behind.<>

Not only that... But Unwetter is alive!$nWhat made him kill Estell?$nWhy did Estell die so helplessly? I wonder...?<>
