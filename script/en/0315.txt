Calintz...!<>

Calintz...?<>

Wun Veto...!?<>

You're late...
The Calintz you are searching for is no more.<>

What...?<>

Calintz is dead, within me...
He dared to accuse me of killing his father,
yet in truth it was he who murdered his father.
In the end, that helped me take over...<>

What the hell are you talking about?
Who the hell are you?<>

That's... Calintz's...<>

Wun Veto, how did you...!?<>

Mephisto, thank you for what you've done.
Great timing. The time we've been waiting
for has come. It's beginnining...
The night for... Magna Carta.<>

Return... Calintz!<>

It's too late.<>

No...<>

I thank you as well. All of the so-called
purifications, transferring Carta... your weapons
should now carry an awesome amount of power.<>

...!<>

Say what...?<>

Magna Carta requires the power of the Ancients.
Such powers that your weapons have become attuned to
after absorbing great quantities of Carta. You've
all been used. Do you think it was an accident that
Felicia, Joker, and Rose all joined Squad Seven?<>

What...?<>

Joker, of course you think you made sharp moves,
but who do you think gave you chances to get Felicia,
to destroy Scaramouche so you would have no place
to return to? Who do you think let Schwartz take
Rose?  Do you understand now?<>

Wun Veto, you...!<>

Very well, I will accept your Carta now.
Pat yourselves on the back for your
participation in Magna Carta.<>

You, you sonofabitch! You toyed with us!
You think we'll just hand over our weapons!?<>

You are not at my level.<>

So... I'll take them.<>

Wun Veto... so you've lied to use as well.
For what? You are one of the leaders of Vermillion.<>

Not quite... I am not someone named
Wun Veto Ropeidon. I'm Tristan, a carbon
copy of Wun Veto, created by a twisted image.
Ooah haha...<>
