What now?<>

Felicia escaped... Joker and some Scaramouche goons helped...<>

What? When...!?<>

We had some of our forces patrol the sewers because$nwe thought he might pull something on us before he left,$nbut he killed them all.$nToo many from Scaramouche showed up...$nFelicia is with the clown.<>

Too many Scaramouche showed up...$nFelicia is with the clown...<>
