Pretty good.<>

Is it the star's turn for the stage appearance?<>

Rose of Vermillion...<>

You know why I'm here?<>

I know Joker tricked you and some of the
Sion Channelers.  However, that does not
justify this aggression.<>

Perhaps if your leader hadn't done
such things in the first place.<>

Joker is no longer the leader.
That is now my role.<>

We're finished.  Joker is dead.<>

...!?<>

Hm?  Joker died?<>

You cannot take Joker's head.  That much
we can guarantee.  Should you continue your cowardly
attacks, know that Scaramouche will form alliances
elsewhere.  There are many who do not approve
of Vermillion's actions.<>

Are you saying he's dead?<>

Felicia...!<>

What about...?<>

Dead.  Do you want to see his corpse?<>

...<>

It's my true name.  No one knew of it.
I'll help you if someone bullies you.
Although I suppose that won't happen
because you're pretty strong.<>

Help.  Save me!<>

Aizen...<>

You're the only one I've told this to, alright?<>

Aizen...<>

What are you so down about?  I'm not dead yet.<>

Huh!?<>

What happened?  I thought he was dead?<>

We take orders from our sworn leader.
Our only leader.<>

You are not of the caliber to lead,
you are barely pathetic enough to be trash.<>

Joker...<>

Again, we meet.<>

As for us, it doesn't matter what action is taken.
That man is no longer a captain of Scaramouche.<>

Hm.  I don't care now.  Whatever side is fine.<>
