Finally you have come.  I've missed you.<>

Unwetter...<>

...!<>

You've got a lot of nerve, to show your face
here after everything you... you...
I've heard about you.
Shupelond soldiers are coming for us.<>

Really, how does the Emperor suit you?
How does it feel for everything to fall on you?<>

...<>

What's your business here now? Do you wish to witness
me being shred to death?  That's quite fair,
I suppose... you dislike me quite a bit.<>

I've told nothing to the Emperor.
I did not betray Vermillion. All I wanted was...
to stop your unreasonable plan.<>

You make excuses pretty well, at least.
What can be done, with the enemy so close?
Do you think I would be tricked by
such ridiculous excuses?<>

Unwetter...<>

Ropei... don...<>

Vermillion punishes traitors with death.<>

I'm sorry...
Sorry...<>

Estell...?<>

Why are you here...?<>

You see now? Tristan is...<>

T, Tristan... you...<>

No... it... wasn't me... this person is...
not my father. It's... a demon.<>

Not me... Estell, and father too...
All killed... by the demon.<>

You see? You are Tristan!<>
