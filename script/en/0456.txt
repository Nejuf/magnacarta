I have no excuse... Unwetter.<>

After all the effort expended to analyze the
princess and her decision to help us, it comes
to this sad excuse of a result. Despite Calintz
discovering the trickery, you missed a chance
at the Emperor, who was by himself. This is a
direct result of your overconfidence and laziness.<>

warned you about Calintz, and yet you make

filled with weaklings.<>

Unwetter... Schwartz Storm is not as weak as you
think they are. There were colleagues of ours who
attempted to assassinate the Emperor, yet they
failed or died. Honestly, our losses until now...<>

Mephisto, ther will always be sacrifices. Should we
pay too much attention to small details, we will
be unable to take steps forward.<>

...<>

Rose, I suppose I gave you too much credit. Will you
agree that it was wrong of me to give you such a
difficult task to handle without enough experience?<>

No, not at all. Next time...<>

What was the meaning of Unwetter's sudden return?
It's been over ten years since I've heard anything
about him. We were sure that he passed away. What
could have have happened to him, to cause such
hatred towards the Empire? It's almost as if the
reconstruction of Krois isn't even on his mind...<>

I apologize, Mephisto... Unwetter's plans were
made useless because of me. I had access to the
Emperor... I took that time too lightly.<>

Blame it on a lack of experience. Unwetter chose you
when I could have gone instead, so I think that shows
how capable he thinks you are.
Don't disappoint him in the future.<>

I know...
You know, he tooks care of me in the slums...
but... somehow it feels like he's changed a lot.
He was strict in the old days, but also kind.<>

It's been a decade since he was missing. He must have
gone through a lot. It's not unusual for someone to
change over such a long time.<>

But somehow... I kind of feel confused.
Of course, I know he's still the 
absolute authority in Vermillion.<>

I couldn't say anything to Rose at all.
I felt the same...<>

Calintz is bothersome but he'll stay in Schwartz.
Now then, it's time to set up a group that can acquire
the Tools of God. Maybe those with natural abilities.
Hopefully they'll gather interesting Carta for me.<>
