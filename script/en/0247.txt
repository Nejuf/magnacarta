I'm afraid that my sister does not
like me very much.  She doesn't even
seem to be trying to talk to me.<>

That's probably because she is not used
to castle life yet.  There is no need for
your highness's concern.<>

How much truth is there in that?
I think she's taken a hatred to me.
I think she's scarred from living an
undesired life in Elder for so long.<>
