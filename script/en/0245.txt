Rose was equal to an officer in Vermillion.
Is is safe to accept her into Schwartz?
More than that, Rose will resist it.<>

True, but she holds enormous spiritual power.
Leaving her alone is too problematic due
to her talents.  She will be of great aid,
that much is certain.  This is ultimately
for the good of our world.<>

I was afraid you were going to 
say something like that...<>

It may not seem fair, but she
must be welcomed into Schwartz.<>
