Why has his majesty permitted 
the imperial princess to return?<>

His majesty has always wished to meet her in person, 
ever since he heard about her. I think he is happy 
to know that he has a sibling.<>

However, should her highness return now, 
there will be many nobles who would support her.<>

There's nothing I can do about it either. 
I asked his majesty to think it over. 
He is a very affectionate child.<>

We must remember that his majesty is the emperor.
We have must think on how to prepare for the chaos
the returning of the imperial princess will cause.<>

That's very true...<>

I think the imprial princess probably thinks of
the permit as a trap of political means.
It is possible, since her mother's death caused
her to lose her power as well.<>

Estell was a very good person. 
Kind, and warm... I can guess how 
she must have felt. 
We had... a very close relationship.<>

Your majesty...<>

There's no need to be worried, Gilbert... 
I am fine. To be honest, I feel very sorry 
for Juclecia. So please... let me welcome her.<>

The fact that his step sister was forgotten 
and exiled to countryside for so long
is breaking his heart.<>

It is very presumptuous of me, 
but it is told that the imperial princess
holds grudges due to the death of her mother,
Estell.<>
