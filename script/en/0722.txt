Schwartz Storm Headquarters - Central Hall<>

These days, the number of monsters has increased and there are many things to fight, but the old skills are not coming out for some reason. Calintz, I would like to tell you something...<>

When performing a general attack using the Space Bar, attacking at regular intervals can result in a continuous attack called a Combo.<>

Until the Final Strike, it's a skill that Schwartz Storm's leaders should try at least once. But it seems that there are even more sword techniques. If you meet someone who has such skills, please introduce them to me.<>

Calintz Jerevinian, it's been a while. I heard what happened. You came here because of my mother...? I'm sorry...<>

I don't know why my mother does that. I like my brother and learned swordsmanship from him, so I'm trying hard here. Will grandfather also acknowledge me someday?<>

Still, it's nice to be able to see my brother often. I want to spar with him again. I learned a lot from Captain Warren here. He's an awesome teacher, you should learn from him! <>

Oh, I went to a bar today and met an interesting guy. Ah...oh, of course not during office hours. He's called Nidboss...<>

He was a wanderer who dreams of becoming a minstrel. Thanks to the fact that I came from Bi-ere, I listened to stories about the Kingdom of Bi-ere and drank...<>

Oh, there was also a person named Proib next to him. He said he was from Marhakatte, and he said with a tired face that he had stayed up all night. After all, various people gather in Shudelmir and it is lively.<>

Sirat's Orakhan, Ladrinne, is working with Captain Gilbert. Who knew that little country would come to power in no time?<>

Ladrinne was originally the crown princess of Krois. She said she was just a beautiful and graceful princess, and she was fortunate to survive the destruction of Krois, but her world was turned upside down.<>

In my opinion, she is a scary woman. She's smiling on the outside, but what she's thinking on the inside... She's still a bit of a baby, and her son hasn't even put Schwartz in the position? Captain Gilbert was too backed up.<>

Women in Schwartz are rare. That's why we tend to catch people's attention. Since Chief Wilhelmina, the number of women in the Schwartz group has increased, but there is still no one like Chief Wilhelmina.<>

Have you seen Captain Warren by the way? I'm not sure if you even can see him. He's incredibly smart. It's a waste for him to be in such a place. <>

He must have tremendous skills. Of course, he never shows them, but... I took a peek at him practicing swordsmanship by himself, and I was surprised. There's no Schwartz in this headquarters right now who could fight him.<>

Are you the Captain Calintz? Hmm, you have swagger like a guard. But how good is your skill? <>

Everyone is watching you, so you better behave yourself. You may be favored by his majesty, King Helios, but the circumstances here in Sirat are different. If you act as you please, you will be noticed right away.<>

Anyway, I look forward to it. Let's see how well you lead the 7th. Because Squad 7 is full of troublesome guys and low-ranking guys. <>

It's been a long time since I visited Schwartz Storm Headquarters, but it's still here! The most prominent building in Delmir...<>

Before I came here, I saw a sage named Gandalf. He was like a very mysterious prophet. I heard you're from Sirat... do you know him?<>

He said there was going to be an upset in Shudelmir. But that's a crazy idea, the place is a fortress!  It'd be strange for something like to happen...<>
