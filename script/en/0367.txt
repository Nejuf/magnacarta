Obviously... I was told that it was around here.<>

Ah, here it is.<>

How to get inside...?<>

Why the hell is this place such a maze?<>

Shouldn't we have turned left before?<>

What are you talking about? Didn't you hear what he said earlier?<>

That was the opposite direction according to the map we bought from the airport, though.<>

Fine. We'll use those folks over there as our guide.<>

Where are you headed?<>

Huh? Hey... Is this girl floating?<>

... <>

He... Hey! We're going to Perusso Laboratories!!<>

Oh, Perusso? It's here, right here!<>

Re... Really?<>

See? Told you! Folks who live around the region give out the best directions!<>

That's odd... You sure this is it?<>

I'm telling you! You see those guards? It's inside. Well... The guards are kind of unfriendly, and they're bad people. So, they'll probably give you hell before you can even get in.<>

If that's the case, leave it to me!<>

Christian! Wait!<>

Who the hell are you, and what is your business?<>

I came to meet your boss.<>

This fool's out of his mind.<>

Forget them. They'll go back.<>

What's the matter with you? To be so inconsiderate...<>

Eh... This son of a bitch is giving me attitude! You, tell your boss to come out!!! We got a victim of his trickery right here!<>

Christian!<>

How... How dare you foulmouth our lord!
Come on! Get out, all of you! Or I'll fix that attitude of yours!<>
