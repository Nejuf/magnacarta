I don't understand either.  She woke up
from her bed, muttered strange things about
purifications and someone being in danger
and then she left.<>

Unexpected... She was slow normally,
yet she moved so fast this one time.<>

I was afraid this would happen.
Felicia must have went to look for Joker.<>

Where is Joker?<>

Joker went back to Scaramouche.  Schwartz kept
an eye on him from the moment he joined.
I suspect that Joker merely acted as if
he didn't notice it.<>

I suppose we know where the 
Scaramouche hideout is then.<>

As with Vermillion, Scaramouche keeps their hideouts
in complicated underground waterways.  One of the
entrances is known because of a specialist which
followed Joker, but we don't know the whereabouts
of the hideout just yet.<>

Then I will go myself.<>

Be cautious.<>

Sure thing.<>
