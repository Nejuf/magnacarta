Really now.
If the Royal Guard's Vice Commander is so amazing,
how amazing are you to be late on our first meeting?<>

That's why I apologized.<>

How many times do I have to apologize
until you stop... it's getting annoying.<>

You. You keep pushing it.<>

Who do you think I am?<>

No matter how you look at it,
I'm the vice captain of the 2nd squad!
Don't you think you should show some courtesy?<>

Since you're not showing courtesy why should I?
Instead of introducing yourself,
you just kept complaining.<>

I was going to apologize but I decided not to.<>

Is that so?<>

I am Ruchielu Chelsea Descralda.<>

I'm the 2nd Squad Vice Captain of Schwartz Storm.
You are Calintz Jerevinian?<>

I heard you're the seventh squad's captain.<>

Yes...
I heard you're Commander Gilbert's sister...<>

I'm an adopted daughter.<>

There is no blood relationship between
us so don't be expecting much of me.<>

That kind of thing doesn't suit me .<>

Seems to be nothing but stubborn women today.<>

Just follow me...<>

...<>

It's because of Ladrinne I got kicked out 
of my unit and assigned to Schwartz Storm.<>


Because I was unable to give a proper introduction, 
I knew this was going to happen.<>

I didn't really plan on being friendly with you.<>

Still, until I see King Helios,
I'll just endure it till then .<>
