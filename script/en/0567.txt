I should go back to Schwartz Headquarters...<>

This place is for commoners.$nShumir and Delmir are short forms of Shudelmir.$nShumir is for commoners and Delmir for nobles.$nThis place is nothing compared to the dazzling Delmir.<>

We and the Delmir people are not on friendly terms.$nOf course, there aren't many nobles here,$nso we have some disadvantages...<>

We hoped that something would change when the new$nEmperor ascended the throne, but nothing big happened.$nI mean, he's only a child,$nso he's probably led by those around him.<>

Do you know Scaramouche?$nThey're very famous around here.$nThey sometimes give out money they've stolen from$nDelmir's nobles. Of course, some say that they$nare lunatics...<>

It's fun watching the nobles hiring guards to catch them,$nbut they'll never be caught. I've heard that they stride$nover the roofs at night wearing strange costumes.<>

Their leader, Joker, is not just reputed for his$nexpertise at thievery.  His fighting is magnificent.$nIt's said that he swings a large scythe with ease.<>
