Now that Juclecia has left, 
we should start getting ready to leave. 
Our mission isn't over until we get back to Shudelmir.<>

Surprisingly nothing happened...<>

Obviously they couldn't do much 
'cause our security is tight. 
They ain't thinking Schwartz would come, see?<>

As if a half-witted numbnut 
like you would matter to them.<>

You, you, you...<>

Ehh...?<>

Uh, that is...?<>

Isn't that the wagon from before...?<>

...?<>

That thing, could it be a fake? 
They must be trying to trick us.<>

Excuse me... are you Schwartz Storm?<>

Yes, we are.<>

We don't understand what happened. 
We were waiting for the third Schwartz squad, 
because we were notified for sure that they 
were to guide us...
No matter how much we waited though,
the guide didn't come to us, so...<>

I can't believe what I be hearing! 
You are completely shameless, I'll give you that. 
Y'all are fakes sent by Vermillion!<>

What do you mean...?<>

Just now, the carriage with her highness came by,
along with Schwartz Team Three. 
Now, who are you people and who do you work for?<>

That, that cannot be... 
We just got here, what do you mean we past you? 
Are you saying someone else posed as us?<>

His majesty is inside the cart for sure...?<>

What insolence you speak...
Of course that's so.<>

I do not wish to be so rude, 
however, I must make sure the person
inside is truly her highness.<>

How impolite of you!
You, even for your job,
dare speak such words...!<>

That's enough. I'll come out.<>

Your, your highness...<>

There must be some kind of misunderstanding. 
You say I passed you... the person inside that 
wagon was truly myself, without a doubt?<>

I only had a brief moment to witness...
but it surely was your highness's appearance.<>

You dare stand in front of her highness...!<>

Anna, wait for just a bit.<>

I carry here the letter from his majesty. 
This envelope has the mark of the royal family on it. 
The letter is written with his own writing. 
Do you need to see that as well?<>

Forgive this insolence, your highness.<>

You're sure there's no need to check?<>

You carry a different glare than the person before... 
I felt some murderous intent in her eyes. 
Your highness now bares a cold and calm grace.
Such must be what is unique to your highness.
We shall chase the fake right away.<>

What do you call yourself, I ask?<>

Calintz Jerevinian of Schwartz Storm, 
Seventh Squad Leader.<>

Very well, Leader Calintz. 
Do you accept the punishment for
your rudeness now, your life?<>

Your highness, why!?<>

Without hesistation...<>

Your highness... 
Such action is unreasonable...<>

Very well. 
Your head is as good as gone now, 
so you must now go and guard his highness 
with your life.<>

As you wish, my liege.<>

Well, shall we go?<>

I thought for real I'd be seeing 
your head get chopped off.<>

Yeah, I did too. Weren't you scared?<>

I sensed that she was bluffing to make me do
something in her favor. It would have been her loss
if she killed me. No one else would go to the rescue. 
Anyway, she's got some balls.<>

Very unlike... Estell. Not like Estell at all.<>

Quite the welcoming party, eh?<>
