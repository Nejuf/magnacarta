When I first saw Estell, I was breathless.$nBeneath luxurious golden hair, warm brown eyes,$nwas a smile that captured my heart,$nI thought all would be well.$nI stayed by her side for a year,$nbut the Court created a ruckus.<>

Your Highness... I was before you...<>

It's okay.$nIt's not important, who's first or who's last.$nBecause you're my wife...<>
