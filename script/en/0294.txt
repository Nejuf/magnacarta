(Juclesia was a fake. So now...what's true? Why don't I remember anything? Why do I only remember Estell's memories every time I met Calintz? Am I... Estell? No. I'm just Adora.)<>

......<>

(The real me...is it gone? Rather, Juclesia seems more real. During the time I slept, she was alive, and she's seen and heard more than me. All of my vacant time and thought is as Juclesia. It's what's written in my memories. Even though I am my true self now... If I can't remember, does my existence, as Adora, mean nothing...?)<>

Ugh...uh...<>

Calintz......?<>

Calintz...? Calintz, what happened?<>

...So vicious...too awful. <>

...Um......<>

Calintz, are you okay?<>

.....Estell...<>

......<>

(Estell...as if I was Estell...)<>

Calintz... this is just a nightmare... relax, just relax. When you wake, everything will be back to normal. <>

...Estell, don't go...<>

I won't go... I'll be with you forever, rest assured.<>

(It's like... it's so close... I think it's somehow the farthest from the world.)<>

(The only things I remember are the days I had fun with Calintz...that's all that sustains me. Calintz...I'm afraid I'll never see you again.)<>
