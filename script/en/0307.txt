... so it ends like this.<>

... Calintz...<>

I have already committed an irreparable sin. Without even knowing it...<>

Even now, I can't understand why I did it... <>

Somehow, I woke up in the imperial palace, drenched in my own dark blood.<>

And, in front of me, His Majesty and Her Majesty lying in blood.<>

... it's already happened. There's no point talking about it.<>

Come to think of it, it was here that we first met.<>

Ah.. back then, Calintz treated me as a strange kid.<>

... So I did. But you showed up out of nowhere and surprised me, like that.<>

I experienced odd flashbacks from the moment I met you. Estell's memories... they felt close and intimate like they were my own.<>

...<>

I thought that as long as I could keep reliving those memories... I could stay alive. That's dumb, don't you think? <>

Believing so strongly in memories that weren't even my own...<>

...<>

Was it the memories, not my own will, that attracted me to Calintz? ... the way I feel about Calintz now, is it real?<>

When I think about those things, my heart feels stuffy for some reason. It frightens me, and makes it even harder to know myself.<>

Still, I... I want to trust that this is not a lie, that it's the pure mind of Adora.<>

Even right now... I am making memories with Calintz as Adora.<>

That's why even should you think me a bother, an annoyance even, I want to stay close to you.<>

Because I like you...<>

I'm sorry that... I was always pulling pranks on you... I just wanted to be near you.<>

I worry that all my talking annoys Calintz, but I keep doing it anyways...<>

Sorry... Even if you hated me, I didn't want to be apart. I wanted you to always think of me.<>

.... I wanted you be the only person in the world who understood Adora.<>

...<>

I... Do I trouble you even now?<>

...Why do you ask something like that?<>

I just... wanted to be sure.<>

... It's just as I told you before. I use to always see Estell in you. I saw her die, yet I couldn't save her.<>

That fact always cut deep in my heart.<>

Even if I could forget Estell, I wouldn't be able to forget the pain and resentment for being so helpless.<>

That's why I practiced swordfighting incessantly. I... I didn't want to see anyone else die before my eyes.<>

Despite all that... it'll be all right from now on. I don't think of you as Estell anymore.<>

You freed me from that pitiful past. I thank you for that.<>

I mean it...<>

... thanks.<>

... You must be tired, why don't you rest your eyes?<>

I'm all right. Calintz, you rest. You've lost a lot of blood. It's so dark out but I can still see your pale face.<>

... I had enough a bit ago, and we can only rest for a moment. We will have to leave this place soon.<>

We have come so far, but I cannot see where to move forward.<>

We've reached the end of the world.<>

Nowhere to run.<>

... Adora. Had I met you sooner... would I have turned out different? Ever since I lost Estell, I've been living as empty shell.<>

Always obsessed with an unescapable past... Maybe I died with Estell when she died.<>

If I had realized sooner who you were, I wouldn't have chosen this path, right? I can't see it now, but there must have been another path.<>

If I could have gone that way...<>

We would be laughing and talking in this garden now. I'd talk about fond memories with Estell, and you'd be getting somewhat jealous...<>

Then...<>

When we first met here, we would have been able to talk in a joyful mood rather than with empty feelings like now...<>

A happy future must have been waiting...<>

I'm sorry... Adora. There must have been another road, but I was only able to see the one...<>

Gasp... because of Ladrinne's drug...<>

(I'm weakening. I won't be able to save anyone like this. I have to get to Ladrinne somehow.)<>
