Hey, we just met.
Do you know how much I wanted to see you Calintz?
It's been awhile but you're being cold...<>


Hey, we just met.

It's been awhile but you're being cold...<>


Every time I see her I feel as if I'm pretending.
As if I know her but... she's similar.
Almost identical...<>

Estell...!<>
Estell......!

Hmm...?<>


Adora... are you all right?<>

Is everyone ok?<>

Probably...<>
Maybe...

I'm not sure what happened.
The current swept us here right?<>

Seems that way.
These ruins weren't stable to begin with.<>

Hmm... so that's why.<>

I wanted to ask you this before...
Who are you?  Where did you come from?
What do you for a living?<>

Um... I... I'm nobody.<>

Rather interesting...
you speak as if you know me yet
you do not seem to know yourself.
You're rather strange.<>

You... you resemble someone I know.
The way you look... even your personality.<>

...<>

I kept my memories of that person locked in my heart.
It's difficult for me to talk about it, although
I suppose I've spent my life running from my past.<>

Every time I see you those memories pop into my head.
That's probably why I don't want to see you.<>

Is it wrong for me to be here?<>

I don't know.
Whenever you arrive though, memories of Estell
come flooding back and the pain flows out again.<>

I... I'm sorry I hurt you Calintz.
If I'm a bother, then I'll stay away.
But... I guess I don't really understand.
I... somehow got a feeling from you.<>


Don't say such strange things.<>

I don't know you.  I don't even know myself.
I don't think I have a past.  Maybe I have amnesia.<>

I feel that when I meet you, I feel as if I'm
finding myself.  I want to try and find myself.
I think that's right?<>

I suppose you wouldn't know, would you...?<>


We need to go check and
make sure everyone's all right.<>

(Calintz I'm... I'm really scared.
You don't know this feeling of loss, of not being
able to know yourself and feeling you will disappear.)<>

(But I won't think about it.  I don't know what's
going to happen, but I'm happy just being with you.
I'm happy with just you, Calintz.)<>
