It's not like I understand anything you say anyway,
but I especially cannot grasp the reasoning behind
your plan to grant our throne to Calintz.
So explain to me father,
what thoughts do you bear now?<>

It's what was done in Sirat for generations...
To pass on the crown to the strongest warrior.<>

You speak of a centuries-old
tradition that is behind the times?<>

...<>

Our ministers argue that Raziel deserves 
to be the next king. He is the rightful 
heir as he has your blood.<>

Raziel is too weak to be king. 
Not only that, I understand that Raziel
himself does not want the crown either.<>

He is still young. 
In time, he too will realize that it is
his rightful duty to become future king.<>

I realize that you still hold a 
grudge against the old ways...
Yet I...<>

Forget it. It is you who murdered him. 
I will not have you excuse yourself. 
I will... crush all that is Sirat.<>

As the result of that incident, 
I was chased away from Sirat Royal Court. 
Such power was what Ladrinne held, 
power that went beyond that of most kings.<>

Sirat will face revolution and it will be 
I who lead it. Rather than being told how
to govern ourselves by stronger countries,
Sirat will become the strongest country.
It will be those other countries then
that will be lead by our hand.
I have grown far beyond the weak child
who cowered under your orders, father.<>
