Roendriger Island East Area - Near Water Ruins<>

The Water Ruins are nearby.
The place is a bit unstable, so there's
the possiblity of collapse. Be careful.<>

Wonder what the Ancients built it for.
It's amazing but... I don't like it much.<>

I'm here to get some medicine, said to be able to 
cure even the deepest wounds. If I bring it to 
Doridori the Merchant, I'll be able to make 
some good money selling it.<>
