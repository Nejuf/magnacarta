This is refreshing... I'm nervous.<>

We're all nervous. We've seen his strength.
If it was Calintz, one fistful would have been enough.
Unwetter, no... was it Tristan?  Whatever his name is,
he's not just a regular thug. He was fighting multiple
opponents and he didn't even slow down.<>

The question is, how do we even fight
after getting our weapons's Carta sucked dry?<>

We have to make do somehow...<>

We will grab freedom with this.
It's over once we manage to shatter the Emblem.<>

To think Unwetter was Calintz... That means we were
used thoroughly from the beginning. Even you, Rose.<>

It's maddening... yet... also bitter.  
It's an odd feeling I'm having. At first 
I thought Unwetter really did come back...<>

Vermillion will have to start over now...
I will tell everyone the truth.<>

So when I was attracted to Calintz...
was it all just the power of the Emblem?
Was the happiness I felt fake too?<>

Adora wasn't real. What am I? 
Nothing but make-believe. Fake. 
Where does my true self... stand? 
If I really am just a creation of the Emblem...
Why do I hurt so much? Why do I miss him so much?<>

Where does this desperate desire to save Calintz
coming from? Is this feeling real...? Is it real...?
Calintz, answer me. Will all the joy I felt
when I was with you be thrown away?<>

Calintz...
I'm coming for you. Wait for me.
Even if I am crushed, Calintz,
you will be saved.<>

One more time...
I want to meet you one more time, Calintz.<>
