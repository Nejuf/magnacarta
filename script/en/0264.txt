(Carta is a means of miraculous power which the
Ancients found.  The ability of these symbolic
inscriptions were beyond imagination.  Sion has
Carta written into it.  Many Carta were inscribed
onto Sion.  Such is the historical record of
our magic.  Carta and Sion...)<>

(Sion needed special care and handling, due to the
potential dangers as a carrier of multiple Carta.
Thus, Sion and its variations have not yet been
categorized.)<>

Commander General, we have finished our analysis
of the archaic document.  I have checked the report
and there is something interesting.<>

Go on.<>

Emblems in the Royal library were actually all Sion
of a special kind.  These advanced Sion could 
apparently only be mastered by men of a certain will.
They are said to be capable of advanced illusion and
even mind control.<>

Emblems of the Ancients...
Are these still kept in the Imperial Library?<>

Pardon...?<>

What?<>

You must have misunderstood me...
The Ancient Emblems are granted to first generation
Orakhans.  Do you not yourself have one?<>

Ah... indeed.  I must have forgotten about it.<>

(How could I have forgotten?
Such a trivial matter...)<>

Commander General... Sir...?<>

What?<>

Ah... pardon me.<>

Anyway, inform me about the distribution
of these Ancient Emblems.<>

Firstly, yours is the Moon Emblem. It represent Vyer 
as you know. The Sun Emblem is owned by Marhakatte,
Sirat has the Earth Emblem and the Orakhan of Krois
had the Wind Emblem which disappeared in the
midst of war.<>

(Exactly... Willight must have used
the Sun Emblem on the Empress...)<>
