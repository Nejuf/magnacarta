Another... failure.
Even Ferenan can't let these things slide anymore.<>

I predicted you would become like this.
You are not capable of such weakness.
In the end, you are most fitting
as a sacrifice for my ideals.<>

A dream... what is the meaning of this dream...?<>

Are you up?<>

Oh...!<>

Welcome to Schwartz Storm, Squad Seven.<>

What are you talking about...!?<>

Though I do not look it, I am your superior.
You will choose your words carefully.<>

"Superior?"  What the hell?
Why would someone like you be my...!?<>

Rose, from this momen, you will not disobey Schwartz.
As Felicia was once hypnotized, so too has your mind
been warped.  We hope you work hard in the future.<>

What... me?  Such cowardice,
do you think I will listen to you?<>

Calling me a coward?
Vermillion is far worse.
Amusingly foolish, talking to warriors
about cowardice in a state of war.<>

I shall die honorably, rather
than becoming a part of Schwartz!<>

You've no right to suicide.  Your duty
is to fight as commanded.  I suppose
you will have freedom to talk about
whatever suits your fancy, however,
keep yourself quiet while in Schwartz.
That's an absolute order to you and your mind.<>

This is bullshit!<>

Fight for our group, from now on.
We demand your talent.<>
