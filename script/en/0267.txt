Come on in.<>

Another purification mission?<>

Something a little more urgent.
We now know that Vermillion are doing 
rune transplants.  They are like purifications.
Our current situation isn't too hot though.<>

Go to the Weldrim Grasslands in Roswell.
There's potentially a Vermillion camp there, as
in the Ristun case.  Roswell is already quite chaotic
at the moment, because a monster herd of considerable
numbers has appeared.<>

We'll be leaving immediately then.<>

Very good.  Start with purification first
and foremost.  Schwartz support will aid
with the monsters in Roswell.<>

Understood.<>

On the assassination of the Duke of Rambleton
and now the monsters at Roswell...
do you believe there's a bigger plot to this?<>

They don't have enough power.  The Vermillion
terrorist attacks are bothersome matters but...
they cannot directly fight the Empire.<>

True... it could be that they're trying to divert
our attention.  The Empress has been oddly quiet.<>

That's been on my mind for some time.<>
