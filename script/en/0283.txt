This isn't how it should be...!<>

We should attack Evell.  It's a great location-

I'm afraid... that area is located in the slums.
Turning the peasants into creatures is...<>

Most of the places outside Shudelmir are like that.

who live safely and comfortably behind the walls of

goals with each bold risk we take.<>

letting pity get in the way of the bigger picture.

What IS the right way, honestly...?<>

What do you fear in dirtying your hands...?<>
