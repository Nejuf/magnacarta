Where is that old man now?$nHe told me that he was going to dig up some plants,$nand I haven't heard from him since.<>

I guess he was gonna sell them to some merchant$ncalled Doridori, or something.$nThere's nothing he won't do for money.<>

Doridori the merchant is known well in Shudelmir.$nThey say he won't ever sell to someone he doesn't like.$nOddball, isn't he?$nHe's very different from the regular merchants.<>

Know about Macaroni?$nIt's a delicacy from the East$nthat has just been imported.<>

It's tasty and cheap too,$nso even the regular guys like us$ncan enjoy a lot of it.<>

When you stop by an inn or a bar,$ntry the Macaroni.$nYou'll see that what I'm saying is true.<>
