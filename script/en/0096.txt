It must be tiring for you,
to handle a case so soon after being accepted.<>

Not at all.<>

Reporting.
Two hours ago at on the eighteen-hundreth hour,
approximately ten monsters broke into the
Duke of Herond's residence.
The second squad is currently handling the incident.<>

The second squad has successfully cleared the
outside of the mansion and are currently securing
the underground passage, reported to have monsters.<>

However, a different set of monsters were recently
found inside the mansion which has caused a commotion
amongst the residents.  I was just informed that most
residents have been safely evacuated.<>

Calintz, your squad is assigned to clear the
remaining monsters in the city.  Look for civilians
and possible attacks by Vermillion forces.
You are to lead Shupelonde forces in the area as well.<>

Did monsters really appear in the underground passage?<>

We have some evidence from witnesses
stating monsters were in the passage.<>

Second Squad Leader Gent is capable, but
should Squad Two require assistance, Squad Seven
is to assist them.<>

Yes sir.<>
