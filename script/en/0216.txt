I'm sorry...<>

Everyone return to base...<>

Calintz, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry...!
I didn't know.  I... I was worried you were wounded.<>

Don't show your face in front of me again...<>

Calintz I'm sorry... I'll...<>

I can overlook most anything else, but I can't
stand lowering my head in shame to that woman.
I do not wish for such disgrace.  The sight of her
laughging at my face is unbearable.  I... I just
didn't want to see someone die unjustly.
Save your thanks and just go away.<>

Calintz...<>

Dammit, why do I need to tell you to...
Get the hell out...<>

Commander!<>

Look Calintz, don't overdo it.<>

Calintz I'm sorry... I'll...<>

Mmph...<>

I didn't mean to hurt her...
Estell's death is pain enough,
I don't need more of that.
That's reason enough too...<>
