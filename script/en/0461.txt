What...?<>

Did you know about... Wun Veto?<>

...<>


It could be said that he's the true leader of
Vermillion. He's a beast. Skill with a blade
that's beyond imagination. He has an oddly long
left arm, and uses it to swing a huge broadsword.<>

Really...<>

Suddenly, I felt dizzy. To say that he was
the leader of Vermillion... Does that mean he's
related to Estell's death...? My mind was
attacked by questions.<>

However... what's the plan behind giving Felicia
to Schwartz? We could just kill her.<>

No, that won't happen I trust. She'll be far above
what they can contend with. She is strong.
She will do well.<>

It seems you're quite fond of her...<>

Let's just say she's worthy of my praise.
I've searched years for her, ever since she
went missing. Yet here she is, and a
Rune Master no less... unbelievable.<>

I once considered adding her to Scaramouche. 
Vermillion would forcefully take her back though. 
If Felicia joined, Vermillion would
never leave Scaramouche alone.<>

If Scaramouche faced Vermillion at its current 
power, it would just be a bitter ending.
Though it may be headed there already...<>

Even so, I can't let it end for the sake of my
little desires. I cannot left Felicia continue
to be a Rune Master either.<>

Because Rune Masters die young...?<>

Rune transfers sap their spiritual power.
It's terrible. Despite knowing that she chips away
at her own life... perhaps she has no clue how much
she scars herself. She will be safe in Schwartz.
Still... it was hardly an easy decision.<>

We'll see about Felicia... but what about you?
We've arrested you and now have custody over you.
You can't expect that you'll be set free after this
situation is over. Unless you escape...<>

Yeah, guess so...<>
