Did Estell go back?<>

Yes, your majesty.<>

Estell's child will be my grandchild...
eventually that child may succeed the throne.<>

I will always stand beside you my lord.
I will do everything in my power to assure
that does not happen.<>

We have worked too hard up to this point.
Estell will not destroy all that we have worked for.<>

We have discovered something my lord.
We think Estell may be a Vermillion spy.<>

What the hell?!  That doesn't make sense.
What does she want from us...?<>

Perhaps they are interested in the Sion of
the imperial family.  Vermillion must be interested
in some kind of strange research involving Sion.<>

We must find Estell immediately...<>

No, my lord.  
I listened to your words and became curious.
I want to see what their plans are.
If Estell gives Sion to Vermillion we will have
established a link with them.  If all goes
according to plan, when Estell goes to meet
Vermillion, we will send a small team of elite
troops and round up Vermillion's leaders.<>

Hm... I wonder.  Is that truly your plan?<>

You should rest, don't worry.<>

You did well, Gilbert.<>

I was just fortunate enough to see it.<>
