You're here.<>

Wilhelmina, what happened?<>

Evell was already ruined, what a mess.$nPeople there turned into monsters.$nThe injuries and death toll for Shupelonde is huge,$nand the Second and Third Squad cannot be saved.<>

Then, Zend is...!<>

I'm going in right now.<>

No, that'll be too difficult.$nIt's already been decided...$nWe're giving up on Evell.<>

What did you just say?<>

Too many people have turned into monsters already.$nThis is beyond the point of return.<>

Unspeakable. You are going to have all$nthose people die just like that?<>

With all due respect,$nOUR side will suffer much greater losses.$nIt was worse when we tried to rescue people.$nFor now, it's best to lock Evell in.<>

Dickless cowards...!<>

Roffma!<>

I'm coming too.$nWe aren't sure whether there$nwill be more survivors or not...!<>

That's beyond our ability now.<>

You're a coward Calintz.<>

...<>

What's it gonna be?<>

I suppose we're going in.$nJesus...$nwhy am I always blessed with those$nwho have more brawn than brains?<>

Calintz, Evell will be shut tight.$nThis is your warning.<>

I have no other choice...$nI am the leader of this squad.<>
