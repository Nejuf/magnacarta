Ugh...<>

This is... the end.<>

What? It's... it's ended? What are you talking about?
Magna Carta has just started.<>

What...?<>

Take care of the funeral preparations for Shudelmir.<>

No... not that...<>

Magna Carta has already begun. You can't stop it.<>

...<>

Are you sad that you can't meet Calintz? I can
change into that form for you if you wish.<>

I don't want his physical appearance,
I want the real Calintz.<>

He's gone. <>

No! Your existence is connected to
the Emblem. If the Emblem breaks...
it's your end as well.<>

...!<>

You want to meet Calintz?
You don't really want to do that, do you?
If I do, the memories of Estell contained
in the Emblem will return. No matter how
much you try to hide yourself with Adora,
you are ultimately Estell, nothing but a copy. <>

...<>

Do you know what the result will be?
If you break the Emblem, you will disappear.<>

...<>

You must miss Calintz...?
But I suppose it doesn't matter if you disappear.<>

Calintz... I wanted to see you before I left.
I guess it's not possible after all.<>

Why is it that this world does not earnestly
seek to fade...? Why is it that what my heart
wants to tell what's not to be told...?
Truly, I loved you... Why does my heart tell me this?<>

I'm sorry... Calintz.<>

Adora...<>

That's strange.
As I came here, I wanted to see you again.
My heart was expecting it...
I guess I was expecting too much.<>

Does it really have to be like this?
I wanted to meet you... Why can't I meet you?<>
