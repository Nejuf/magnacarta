Tristan... why would he...?<>

Are you okay...?<>

Ah... you, how did you...? I thought you...<>

You've been underestimating me.
You think I'll die to scrubs?<>

...<>

Not everyone in Vermillion is your subordinate, "bro."
As a matter of fact, I myself have plenty
of men with me.<>

Well anyway bro, I was pretty worried because
facing your blades is no easy task, but it seems
like someone totally unexpected did the deed for me.<>

Ya, Yade, you won't...!<>

You were an idiot to be tempted by something uselessly
powerful like the Magna Carta. I don't intend to
destroy the place I plan to rule.<>

So go on and... die, brother. Die for me.<>

Sorry. I did want to avoid killing you,
but there wasn't any other way.<>

From this moment on, I put the past behind me.
No more "Former Prince of Krois." No more
"Yade of Filthy Vermillion."<>

I will be born again. This pitiful past along
with my entity will be erased...
I will be born anew.<>

I bet the Sion Ancients granted me, offering my past
as a mortgage... and from now on, I will become the
perfect man. A man everyone will look up to.
Just as I have so often dreamed.<>

...!!<>
