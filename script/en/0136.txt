We've been waiting.<>

The situation is?<>

Most Ristun residents have safely evacuated.$nThere is a rumor floating around saying that$na few treasure hunters went into the old ruins,$nit seems those hunters were turned into monsters.<>

Vermillion's behind this...?<>

Seems so. Normal monsters usually stay in dark places,$nand considering they came to town themselves,$nthey must be under mind control.<>

I see.<>

The sooner we start purification, the better.$nThe residents of Ristun looked at us$nas if we're some heroes to save them.<>

Obviously. They'll starve in the shelter if they$ncan't get back to the town.$nDo you even know what it's like?<>

I'm not unfamiliar with that...$nCan you stop treating me like a rich kid now?<>

I'm getting used to the Schwartz life.$nAlthough he acted like he wouldn't care if I quit,$nthe general really was decent enough to$noverlook my straightforwardness.$nEveryone thought of the team as a bunch of oddballs$nfrom the start anyway, so they looked down on us.$nBut that's all they can do. Look.$nIt seems pretty easy to survive here.<>
