I don't know what is... why did I kill His Majesty the Emperor? Why...why did I do that...why am I...for what?
I didn't do it. Someone other than me... it's not me, this is...! I don't remember anything.<>

Are you blaming others again? You're pretending to be strong and shrinking in critical moments, you.<>

What...?<>

It's your fault for not controlling yourself.<>

What... who's talking?<>

......You seem to be coming to your senses now.<>

...Ladrinne......<>

You must have been pretty tired, right? To sleep, even like this.<>

......<>

As I expected, my father was deceived by you. No, I too have been deceived. Well, you've been messing up everything on your own since long ago. Anyway, this is the end. My father adopted you and tried to make you ascend the throne despite my protest.<>

......I didn't do it. <>

That's impudent. There is evidence of a rebellion, but you're just looking for a hole to escape, right?<>

Rebellion...? Do you think I would have left evidence if I really did assassinate your Majesty?<>

When I confronted Ladrinne, still confused about everything, it suddenly seemed to flash in my mind. Everything vivid in my head. The bloody corpses that had fallen in front of me, Adora in the form of Juclesia...It felt like everything was manipulated.<>

Well... if I really am an assassin, how could I have been caught so easily? Honestly looking at the circumstances, it's easy to guess who would benefit most from your Majesty's death. Isn't that you, Ladrinne?<>

What...?<>

Always pretending to be noble, convincing everyone that not the one wearing a mask.  You've been eager to see me imprisoned like this. Are you feeling relieved now? No... no. You won't be relieved until I die. If I'm alive, you don't know when I'll get in your way again.<>

...Foul woman, just how far would you go for power?<>

......!<>

Hmph, what do you know? My father... was lifesaver to you. But me, I'm just an enemy you want to kill. My husband, my son... who were their deaths for? <>

Ugh......!<>

It's because of him. At least I thought my father would... help me. But in the end, he trampled my happiness recklessly. Rather... when Krois was destroyed, he should have left me for dead. <>

Ugh...uh...<>

For what... why did he save me, to use me? Why did he make me such a cruel woman! If only my husband was alive...if only my child was alive...why did it happen!<>

Ugh......<>

Like you, I don't know anything. I feel terrible... like you...<>

......<>
