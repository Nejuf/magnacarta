I should see Ladrinne since I'm in Shudelmir.<>

Princess Juclecia is the daughter of Estell,$nand she has suddenly decided to return to the$npalace, apparently.<>

There are rumors that those who support the Princess$nwill gain power.<>

Although, the palace is full of things that$naren't discernable.<>

Schwartz Storm keeps this place safe after all.<>

Oh, did you know that a new Captain$nhas arrived for Squad 7?<>

I'd like to see him. I've heard that he was the$nVice-Captain of Sirat's Royal Guards.$nI also understand that he is...$nrather handsome.<>

You... do you know about Sions?$nThey're containers for Carta.<>

Of course, you must know them well$nbecause Schwartz uses them.<>

The Krois Kingdom once had a great number of Sions.<>

Do you know about the treasure chests$nspread about Shudelmir?<>

There are many types, but the Golden and Silver chests$nare the rarest. You'll need Golden and Silver keys to$nopen them accordingly.<>

Well, I'm not certain what's in those chests...$nThe increased taxes are breaking my back.$nMaybe I should try to get some cash from them.<>

Shudelmir might not be in a dire state, but everywhere$nelse is swarming with monsters, and it's all$nbecause of Vermillion.<>

They are a resistance group comprised of the $nsurvivors from the Krois Kingdom.$nThey've become more active lately.<>

I've heard that they don't attack poor people.$nMaybe they're sympathetic towards the poor.<>

His Royal Majesty is a kind person, unlike his father.<>

His father destroyed the Krois Kingdom $nwithout even faltering.<>

He looked kind, but the truth was$nthat his veins ran with ice.<>

I no longer want to go to that Sirat Orakhan$nmanor as long as Ladrinne lives in there.<>

This is the Schwartz Storm Headquarters.$nThe most famous building in Delmir.<>

Commander Gilbert is not only a Commander for Schwartz,$nbut also an Orakhan for the Sirat Kingdom.<>

Everyone respects Commander Gilbert.<>

Only those within Schwartz Storm can equip$nweapons freely inside Shudelmir.<>

Some like it that way, and some don't.<>

You can't satisfy everyone I suppose.<>

Eastern Region of Delmir<>

Are you calling me a monster?$nI'm really a human reporter.$nI'm disguised like this for a scoop.$nIf you get a chance to read my report,$nplease read them till the end.<>

You're looking for John Nash?$nI'm afraid you've found the wrong person.$nMy name is Timsungterre.$nWilliam Parcher here will explain the details.<>

Why do you keep talking to me? I know you think that$nI'm drunk, but I've only drunk two bottles!<>
