It's not time to go back yet.<>

I'm a short track competitor.
If I can be first, I'll do anything!<>

Pulling, hanging by the legs, doubting,
cutting off shoelaces, farting.
But saying my mustache is cute.  
Hehe, it was a shock.

From then onward I've been watching 
Hollywood movies and teaching myself.<>

As a result I mastered the ability to trick others.
Hehehe.  What, are you saying I'm a coward?
Perhaps it's time to meet Tom Sunterura.
He's the worst...  Believe it or not...
Do you know a place that makes good dog meat?
I don't know if I should eat it or not...
Ismael are you going to hit me?
Are you going to hit me?<>
