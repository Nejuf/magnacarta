Hoho, thanks. I knew you'd come for me.<>

How did you know about this place$nand how did you creep in?<>

Uhh... Woman's intuition?<>

Don't think you'll just leave with a joke.$nThe information about us being here was top secret,$nhow did you know about this?$nAre you a spy from Vermillion, by any chance?<>

No... I just came here because I felt like it...<>

Because you felt like it... When are you going to stop with the inane answers?<>

Calintz...<>

...<>

Forget it Calintz. There really is a possibility$nthat she met us coincidentally.$nAren't you being too cynical?<>

This isn't a coincidence...$nI just know. I can feel where Calintz is.<>

In the future... Don't pull stunts like this.$nIf you keep showing up using a coincidence$nas your only excuse, then I,$nas a Captain of a Schwartz Squad,$nwill give you a formal examination.$nTo be quite frank, you're getting in my way.$nEvery time you show up, it's unnerving.$nYou bother me when I'm working.<>

I thought he didn't look too happy.$nWhat's the matter with him, did he$nget scolded by bro or something?<>

Let's just go, don't mind him.$nIt'd be bad to attract monsters here again.<>

Bleh... Calintz's stupid.<>

You... What's the real deal? <>

Huh...?<>

You don't know?<>

...?<>

Look Uncle Roffma Musclehead Stupid the First,$nyou're paying a lot of attention to her.$nDo you like her that much?<>

What are you talkin' about? It's just...$nShe just reminds me of my sister.$nI didn't get to visit her for a while$nbecause we got busy recently.$nI don't know how they're doing.<>

You care about your family that much?$nHeh... It kinda suits you though.<>

I'm in Scwhartz for my family.<>

I envy you... I wish I had a family like that...<>
