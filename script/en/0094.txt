Just three people in this group including me...
and they call this a squad...<>

Ugh, is this why Ladrinne said this was child's play?<>

What the hell?  I was expecting something a 
little more intimidating from the man they
called the Phantom of Avalanche, not some punk.<>

Such a kind thing to say to your Captain.<>

He's always like that, it's his hobby.<>

Shut up.<>

At least he's handsome.  
Certainly better than a brute like you.<>

I thought I told you to shut up!<>

If you're looking for a fight then step forward.
I'm certainly interested about this so-called squad.<>

Don't think you can order me around.
The last commander got his jaw
broken for his cheap pride.<>

Don't get your hopes up.
What are Squad 7's duties?<>

That should be fairly obvious.
We go out and kill shit.<>

Killing monsters for those rich bastards,
only to be killed someday and be forgotten.<>

So why are you still here?  Leave.
No one's stopping you.  But, I'm guessing 
you're not good enough to go anywhere else.<>

What!?<>

If were to attack me you'd be removed for
assaulting a superior officer.  Correct, Roffma?<>

You were a mercenary until a year ago and 
you joined this group for money, yes? Typical.
Yet I wonder how you managed to stay in Schwartz
with such a compulsive attitude?<>

My brother cut him some slack.<>

Regardless of your history, you need the money to
raise your family.  I'd hardly think you would
want to be removed for misconduct.<>

Hmph, investigation is it?<>

Yes, investigation.  A leader should know that much.
The choice is up to you, but there are no places
like Scwhartz for the money.
You don't have much choice.<>

Huhu...<>

Good to see there's at least one member.
Let's get along, Roffma.<>

Who'd work with a bastard like you...<>

Ah, so you don't need the money?<>

Goddammit...<>

Well that was fun.  The last Captain
cowered in fear when all Roffma did
was clench his fist.<>

He must've been an idiot.<>

Huhu... You really can kill people with words.<>

Thanks for the compliment.<>
