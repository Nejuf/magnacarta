Please pardon Calintz and Adora
You have the power.<>

No... it's something even I cannot do.<>

Why?  Brother, you be regent soon.<>

Regency doesn't grant everything.<>

Calintz is charged with assassination, and Adora,
despite being used by Willight, was directly involved
with the incident regarding the false princess...
These alone are huge crimes.<>

It's... saving them is not something within my grasp.<>

But...
They didn't mean for this to happen.  This isn't fair.<>

If there's no clear evidence in their defense...
There's nothing I can do about this incident.<>
