It's been a while hasn't it, Rose?<>

Hmph...<>

What are you talking about?  You know this place?<>

We used to play in the Sihara forest.
Ferenan, Rose and me... When we were young,
we hung out.  We were about the same age.<>

So you used to be Vermillion?<>

It would be more accurate to say my father was.
He once told them that he had nothing with
Vermillion and because of that, we had to
run away.  For the longest time in my life
we were running.  The punishment for
leaving Vermillion was death.<>

Seems like you got out safely.<>

Yes, although...
I think my father died by Wun Veto's hand.<>

Wun Veto...!?<>

He was the true leader.  Originally Ferenan's father
carried the title, but the orders were coming
from Wun Veto.  I think my father went by the name
Yeadde...  he was part of the inner circle.
It seemed that he was opposed to the terrorism
promoted by Vermillion...<>

So that led him to quit and run.  The Prince of Crois,
the Royal bloodline... ran without dealing with
the reconstruction of Crois.<>

Treat your words carefully.
What would you know about my father?<>

Wun Veto was disappointed.  He planned a new Crois,
aided by Yeadde.  Yet, he was betrayed.<>

A new Crois full of innocent men,
killed like common beasts?<>

What can be accomplished without sacrifice?
Do you think there is success with mere words?<>

So turning men into monsters is justified?
Vermillion always retorts with their high ideal
of a reconstruction of Crois.  Little else.<>

Stop your bickering, both of you.
We're on a mission.  Stop provoking Joker, Rose.
That's an order.<>

Dammit... I know already.<>

Heh heh, can't do anything against a direct order eh?
Orders even control our stuck up little princess.<>

Shut your mouth...<>

Now that the story's over, I suppose that means
Joker is the heir of Crois.  I wasn't aware the
Crois family retained a blood survivor.<>

I've put such matter behind me.  I don't care about
the reconstruction of Crois.  The thing that ticks
me off is Wun Veto.  He's the cause of my father's
death.  I'm not letting that guy leave unscathed.<>

Wun Veto...<>
