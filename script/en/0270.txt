Now then...<>

This, this is your fault!  Damned Schwartz...!<>

Stop.<>

Damn... damn you!  You'll face death!  Someday!<>

Your body will not let you kill fellow members.
No matter how you feel about it, you are a
Schwartz Storm, and as a member of Squad Seven,
you will follow your Captain's orders.<>

(I... shit... my, my arms...)<>

The next time this happens, you will stab yourself
with your own magic.  This is your warning.<>

Calintz, this is too much.<>

Schwartz is an elite mercenary group 
funded by the Shudelmir military.
It's not a playground for children.<>

But, really...<>

Adora.  I've said nothing about you coming with us
in our missions and I will not because I have let you
come in the past.  That said, I will not let you stand
in the way of my disciplinary measures towards my 
Squad.  It is my duty to lead this team.  
My orders will be upheld and will not be questioned.<>

(Somehow Calintz is... more easily bothered.
I wonder what happened?)<>
