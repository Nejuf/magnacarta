Felicia, just a little more.<>

You tricked me.<>

You were a fool to believe me. I had you fooled a long time ago, harassing the innocent commoners and raging about destroying the royal family. <>

What makes you think you can get away?<>

And what makes you think you can just stand there and block the exit? Do you really think I couldn't beat you?<>

What are you talking about? Didn't you ever think there was a reason I left Felicia alone?<>

......!<>

Felicia, come here. <>

Felicia?<>

It's no use. You didn't know? Sion Channelers are all brainwashed to listen to Vermillion's orders first. Just try to do something stupid. I could order Felicia to commit suicide right now.<>

You sure you can do that? If you kill Felicia, Mephisto won't let you go.<>

Well, if you just stay still, you won't have to find out.<>

......<>

Do you understand me? If you so much as lift a finger... Felicia could be dead immediately.<>

......<>

Felicia......<>

Felicia, kill Joker.<>

......<>

Why are you hesitating? <>

Ah......<>

Ugh......<>

Good. Yes, Felicia! You're killing Joker!<>

Come on!<>

......The body is not listening. <>

That's it.<>

......!<>

It would be best to take that order.<>

You, what new...!<>

He told me to take the order.<>

Feli...Fe, Felicia, stop it.<>

......Felicia.<>

You're safe!<>

You said you couldn't die. <>

......To them.<>

You were caught up in the moment. Now you know why I said it was silly?<>

What about Joker...what are you going to do with me? <>

Order Felicia. You don't need to follow anyone's orders in the future. <>

What? Whose orders...!<>

I hope that I no longer have a need for this sword. I don't want to attack people any more than I have to.<>

......Felicia......<>

Make Calintz a man!<>

......!<>

What, what, this is...?<>

Ha, haha... did you think I'd pass the proposal that was important to you? You seem to have trusted your old friend so far. <>

Joker......<>

I would have advised you not to trust him.<>

.......Mephisto!<>

I'm just, here for Vermillion...<>

So, were you satisfied that you had the advantage over Joker?<>

......<>

It's been a long time. <>

I don't want to waste a conversation with you.<>
