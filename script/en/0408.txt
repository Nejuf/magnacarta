What the hell? Then that means Joker
cooperated with Calintz from the beginning and...<>

It was a chance to get a Sion Channeler.
There probably wouldn't be any reason 
for even my brother to oppose that.<>

Even so, keeping that secret from us is
going too far. We're no idiots,
we would have cooperated too.<>

Anyway, did Joker get so desperate that he
had to do such things to protect Felicia?<>

He could have just run away with her by himself,
why pretend to be caught by the Schwartz?<>

Joker can't keep her safe by himself.
Vermillion would know who took Felicia
if if she disappeared, and they're
not going to sit and do nothing about it.<>

The this is basically Scaramouche's
declaration of war against Vermillion.<>

Then...<>

Maybe Felicia will join. Joker though...
I don't know what's going to happen to him.<>

Aren't they going to lock him up?
He's still from Scaramouche.<>

Technically Joker found Felicia for us... technically.<>
