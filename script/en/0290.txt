Commander, it's me. Are you inside?<>

What happened? It's not like you to be embarrassed like this.<>

It's a big deal... <>

Now... the news has arrived. Her Majesty and the prince were assassinated...<>

What......?<>

Besides... I heard that the assassin of Her Majesty and the prince...<>

Calintz...?<>

But even more than that, the Empress and the nobles who followed Orakhan Willight's lead are saying it was the commander who ordered the assassination. <>

......<>

Orakhan Willight.<>

What happened to the Orakhan so far...?<>

Orakhan Gilbert, on the order of Her Majesty the Empress, I will arrest you for the assassination of the Queen Leona and her son, Shurenlord. <>

That's... nonsense. Commander would never...<>

Fine... I will go to the imperial palace myself and see Her Majesty the Empress. And I will prove my innocence.<>

You want to prove your innocence? Good. If you can prove it, do it.<>
