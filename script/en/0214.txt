Hey, you okay?<>

God... damn...<>

Stay still, you're hurt.<>

Where... is this?<>

You're inside Orakan Mansion.
You were losing blood like crazy.
You sure you're okay?<>

I'm not gonna die from this...<>

Right... I kinda needed you to wake up.
Chelsea is in Orakan's room, we've got
a bad situation on our hands.<>

Something wrong...?<>

Adora was arrested.  Seems she was dealing with Rose.
She apparently attacked Orakan's guards and...<>

What?<>

Chelsea is trying to explain that Adora
is not with Vermillion, but Orakan
doesn't believe that...<>

We don't honestly know if she is or not.<>

Look, you're being really cruel.  Orakan is incredibly
angry about this.  If things get bad, Adora can
be executed without trial.  You know how those in
Vermillion are dealt with once captured.<>

(Shit... 
The last person I want to bow to is that woman.)<>
