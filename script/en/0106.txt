Damn. You'd think once you get out of $nSirat you'd be better off...$nNothing much really changed.<>

Trying to swing the sword with a$nwounded arm made the cut even worse.$nShould I have left the last of the monsters to other guys?<>

I guess I didn't want someone to die in front of me.<>

I guess that's how pitiful my personality is...<>

My arm was almost moving by itself, though...$nEven when I wanted to keep it down...<>
