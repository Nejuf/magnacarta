This assassination of the Duke of Rambleton
is obviously a terrorist attack by Vermillion...
there's no doubt about it.  It's just as the
residency of the Duke of Herond was attacked
by monster a while ago.<>

The why are there no monsters this time?
Wasn't he killed by some guy?<>

Yeah, my brother told me that he was stabbed
in the chest by an enormously big broadsword.
It must have been a really skilled assassin
if he could swing such a broadsword with ease.<>

I bet the high and mighty noblemen are
going to freak out about it now.<>

Hey Calintz, I think my brother is looking for you.<>

Captain!<>

Hm?<>

What are you daydreaming about?
The Commander General called you.<>

Oh... right.<>
