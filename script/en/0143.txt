You've impressed me by arresting$nJoker of Scaramouche. Well done.<>

There's... something creepy about it.<>

What?<>

Well... There's some feeling that he$nplanned for us to capture him.$nI'm not saying the enemies were weak, but...<>

Not to mention Scaramouche$nwas there instead of Vermillion,$nwhich was whom we suspected to be there...<>

Seeing as how creepy he looks,$nI'm just saying that he could be plotting something.<>

Vermillion and Scaramouche could$nhave formed an alliance, even though our$nintelligence didn't know about it.<>

You think something about this situation is strange too?<>

We'll have to wait and see.$nDon't take your eyes off Joker.$nThat scum's specialty is escaping.<>
