Mmm... I'll leave now.<>

Eh? To where?<>

Uh... Mmm, I just gotta go.<>

...?<>

So yeah, I'll be off. Later, Calintz.<>

...<>

That kid, who is she? She's your friend, right?<>

I don't know her at all either.$nShe just shows up and bothers me...<>

Maybe I was feeling otherwise on the inside,$nnow that I think about it.$nIt was an odd feeling, to have met Adora.$nIt was almost as if I went back to past.<>

You think she could have been a friend from long ago,$nor something? You know, the kind you don't really$npay much attention to and forget...<>

I don't know...<>

Ah... I just thought of something.<>

I'll go now.<>

Hurry up and go...<>

Yeah. Stay well. I'll come by... sometime.<>

You really don't have to.<>

You're back to your square self already.$nI'm going back to the castle, but that$ndoesn't mean I can't come back.$nI can always ask his majesty.<>

...<>

The past three months have been fun, haven't they?<>

...<>

Calintz... That was first time I ever cried.$nEven though I never got caught... looking weak.<>

Ah, right. The promise.<>
