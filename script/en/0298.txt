There's a weird rumor spreading amongst the noblemen
inside the castle.  They say that Empress Leona
will be chased away and that Estell will be the
new successor to the throne.<>

What kind of talk is that?<>

Estell is the mother of the princess, and the
Marhakatte faction, including Willight, support her.
Don't you think we left Estell alone for too long?<>

She is not of a caliber to execute a coup d'etat.<>

Maybe that was true when she first arrived here.
I think she's spent enough time here to get accustomed
to power.  On top of that, the Emperor will make an
official announcement next year to renown Juclesia
as the heir.  What reason will she have to spy on
Vermillion then?  How can we know of her loyalty?
It's possible Estell has already
told the Emperor the truth.<>

What's more suspicious is that no letter has come
from her ever since she told us that she found
the final Sion.  Even I could not contact her on the
day of the the appointment.  All of the servants I
told to keep in touch with the Empress have vanished.
There is no way she could have missed our suggestion
for the meeting.  Doesn't that seem odd?
Why would she ignore our requests? She used to be us
for help... I wonder if she does not fear us anymore.
I'm worried about getting stabbed in the back.<>

(You're easy to read, Ropeiden.  
You never did trust anyone easily.
That's why you listen to rumors.
Or, does this mean you only trust me as much?)<>
