What are you staring at?
You've been acting odd recently.<>

N, no, that's not so, your highness.
By any chance, have you felt tired or dizzy lately?<>

There's no reason I should.  Why do you ask?<>

No reason.  I was just worried about your well being
because of the ruckus at the party last time.<>

Nothing big happened.
How is Vermillion currently acting?<>

Ehm... they don't seem to trust our words.<>

If they don't believe us,
we will have to go ourselves.<>

Your highness?
Your highness should not bother with such danger...<>

Sir Willight, I had to eat unspeakable things
to survive in Elder.  Do you supposed I would be
bothered by anything after such a life?<>

Truly... like your highness.
It shall be as you wish.<>

Of course, your highness's direct conversation
with Mephisto had a great impact on these matters.<>
