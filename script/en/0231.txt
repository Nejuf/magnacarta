They run.  There isn't anything
else they know how to do.<>

Are you alright?<>

It might have been better if
I was forgotten...<>

Aizen...<>

Heh, take a joke.<>

Boss...<>

This is how it should be.  I am no longer
a leader of Scaramouche.  To be honest,
I cam here to find Felicia.  There are
always informants in the thief guilds.<>

You were... always a traitor.<>

I've no excuse to utter even if died earlier.<>

...<>

I'm finished with Scaramouche.  That was my
intention from the beginning.  No, rather I
am here to put an end to Scaramouche.
I've no need of this guild now.  Though...
I suppose I've delayed my decision long enough.<>

I can accept that.  If you wish to take Scaramouche,
then come... tradition dictates your action.
Such nonsensical traditions.<>

Fine.  I created the rule and I will serve it.<>

...<>

Come Felicia.  The mission must succeed.<>

...<>

You are a member of this squad.
Follow your captain's orders.<>

If you will.<>

Just don't make things any worse...<>

Heh...<>
