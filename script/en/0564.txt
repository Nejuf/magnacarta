What... exactly do you do, Estell?<>

Huh?  Why ask something like that now?<>

After you returned to the castle...
You were talking about strange things with father...
I don't understand what you're trying to do.<>

Nothing, just something adults do.<>

I'm not a kid.  I'm already over 10 years old.<>

Ooooh, little master's grown so big.<>

Tch...<>

Calintz... I want you to grow up without
this hardship.  You'll live happily won't you?
I hope so.<>

What does that mean?<>

I... nothing.<>
