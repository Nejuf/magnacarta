I'm saying there are too many of these relics.$nPurification should be over by now.<>

About the Vermillion scum...$nIf they hate the Imperial family so much,$nwhy don't they just show up themselves?$nWhy are they getting innocent people$ninvolved in the matter?$nThe only reason they have done so was$nbecause they were from Shudelmir.<>

...<>

Boo!<>

...!<>

Haha, totally scared, huh?<>

She startled me... What is she?<>

Hey, how...?<>

It's been a while, but you look so angry...$nI'll be sad.<>

Who is that? Your girl, Calintz?<>

Stop with that crap.$nI'm the one who wants to ask who she is.<>

Hey! So you're Calintz. I see now.$nYou still remember my name?<>

What if I don't...?<>

Oh my gosh, that's cold.$nWe even kissed, aren't you going too far?<>

Huh...!?<>

Or you could just tell them the truth,$nthat you did what you felt like doing.<>

Hey, I didn't think of you like that.$nSo, where did you find someone like her?<>

This area is restricted, how did you get in?$nDid the Shupelonde guards let you in?<>

I told them I'm with Squad Seven, and they let me in.<>

Full of morons...$n
Look Adora, we are here for a mission,$nwe aren't on a picnic. So turn around$nand go back to where you came from. Now.<>

See, I knew it. Come on, you knew my name.<>

Right, well, whatever. Just leave.<>

Hey, we just met again.$nYou know how I missed you Calintz.$nIt's been a while,$nso why are you treating me like a stranger?<>

...<>

Speaking of a while,$nyou grew a little taller since I last saw you.$nYou're not the little brat from before.<>

Don't... call me a little brat.<>

Heehee, ok, Little Calintz.<>

You're here for your father? Well, get going then.<>

Come on, we just got to talking.$nI missed you a lot, don't be a stranger...<>

...<>

...<>

Calintz, what't the matter?$nAre you upset about something?<>

This is incredible, how can two$ncompletely different people act alike?$nThe looks, behavior, even the way she speaks...$nit's almost as if Estell came back to life...<>

You...<>

I waited even though I missed you, can't I come with you?<>

You'se some girl,$nspeakin things like that with a straight face.$nLook, Calintz, what's the deal? It's up to ya.<>

...<>

Isn't it dangerous to make her go back by herself?$nWe've gotta keep her with us, for her safety...<>

You're so transparent it's obvious.$nYou just want pretty women with us.<>

Wha, what the hell's with you? I, I'm... See...$nWell, ya know, doing this for chivalry's sake.<>

Empty fools know chivalry now? Amazing.<>

You, you... Really now...!<>

Fine. For now... you move with us. <>

Wee, I'm in! Um, I mean, anyway, I know how to fight.$nI know how to use swords. So I won't be disturbing you.$nYou can count on me!<>

So much like Estell...<>
