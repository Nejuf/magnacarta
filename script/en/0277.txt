It's too late...
He's partially a monster now.<>

Joey...!<>

Roffma...?<>

It's alright Joey... It's alright...<>

It's already...<>

Quiet! This is my brother you're talking about!<>

Roffma...<>

Joey, how ya feelin'?
Where are your brothers and sisters?
Why are you here alone?<>

Dead...
Why didn't you come?
Everyone... was waiting for you.
We were so sure you were going to come for us...<>

Damn...
Dammit...<>

Roffma...<>

I'm sorry...<>

...<>

You're... you're going to live...
You'll be okay, so...<>

Really...?<>

...!<>

Ohh...<>

Jo, Joey...!
Calintz, what the hell? Shit, you...
you son of a bitch! Are you out of yo' fucking mind?<>

Roffma, it was necessary.
You left yourself vulnerable to a monster.<>

How could you do that to Roffma's brother...!?
Calintz, that's too far! The child wasn't even...<>

Safety for my ally is of more concern.<>

But, he was clearly conscious,
he was talking just fine! He was not a monster!<>

And if he turned into one?
Could I finish him then...?<>

...!<>


Amongst the monsters you've dealt with, I know for 
sure that there are plenty who were originally human 
beings.  Finishing a monster off, or fininshing
something that's turning into a monster, it's all
the same.  Better to kill it than it killing us.<>

How... How cowardly.<>

...<>

Bastard! Calintz, I'll kill you, you damned...!<>

Think, you moron.  Calintz is right. He was not a human.
He definitely wasn't acting like one...
Calintz saved your ass.<>

SHUT UP!<>

If you're going to blame someone, blame the Schwartz
who screwed up.  If they focused on finding enemy
Rune Masters like they should have, instead of
barricading the town, things wouldn't have come to
this.  They were cowards.  They didn't want to deal
with something dangerous.<>

What... hell... man...!<>

Roffma... Listen.
This is to save people's lives.
You need to understand.<>

Goddamn it... y'all leave me alone.<>

Roffma...<>

I'm telling you, get the HELL out of my face!<>

Let's... leave him alone for now.
I'm sure he knows it too, that we
couldn't save the kid.<>

Joey... I'm so sorry. You looked so hurt...
I didn't... I couldn't... that this would happen...
If I was here for you...<>

Kekeke... why, that's why you're a moron, Roffma.<>

...!?<>
