Rowell Forest - Near Shudelmir<>


Young man, you seem skilled with a blade.
Do you know the basics?  Once you enter a battle,
there will be an area of movement within which you
can move.  Press the Space Bar Button to attack.
Time the Space Bar presses to perform combos.
Watch your TP gauge in the lower right corner,
it determines how far you can move and your ability
to attack your enemies.<>

If you want to see your skills, press CTRL
or right click to bring up the menu.
If you're short on TP you can use the 'D' key
to end your turn or bring up the menu to end it.<>

Keep in mind the words of this old soldier.
So long...<>
