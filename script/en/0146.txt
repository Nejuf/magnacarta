Can you manage it boss?<>

I can somewhat. Regarding Rose?<>

She stays inside for the time being.$nWe think the tight security of Ristun$nprevents her from getting out.<>

That makes sense... keep up your guard though.<>

Count on me.<>

Come on, eavesdropping is quite a rude hobby.<>

I think I'll see you escape quietly one day.<>

Then what? So you're saying because I can leave$nthis place if I want to, you want to lock me in$na cell with a sturdier lock, or something?<>

I speak because I don't wish for that to happen.<>

I take it that you are ready for a deal then.<>
