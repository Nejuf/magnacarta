Estell... is gone.  I've failed to protect,
and even lost Estell.  Someone so precious to me...
It will forever be a scar in my mind.<>

How long are you going to droop over that?<>

Estell was always hurt because of father,
but I could only watch her.<>

So you know yourself well.
In the end you were a weakling.<>

I longed for revenge... I wanted to get Tristan
for what he's done to my father... and Estell.<>

HA, what candor.  Revenge?  
You wanted revenge?
You had your revenge.<>

!!<>

Calintz... something bothering you?<>

No... it's nothing.<>
