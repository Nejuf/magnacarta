Why are you here?<>

Orakhan...<>

What brings you here, Calintz? To a place like this?<>

Nothing more than... taking a walk.$nI was passing by and I noticed a beautiful garden.$nThis place isn't owned by anyone, right?<>

This place isn't owned by anyone, right?<>

Oh, so you didn't know. I bought this estate long ago.<>

Oh, is that right? Pardon me.<>

Are you willing to keep the place looking$nlike a wasteland, though it's your land$nbought with your money?$nI guess the land doesn't tickle your fancy?$nThe garden looks fine, though.<>

I guess the land doesn't tickle your fancy?$nThe garden looks fine, though.<>

That's true. I was planning to build a new house over it.$nWe'll build over this cruddy garden, and update this place.<>

Is that right...<>

Anyway, this is my property,$nso I wish you would restrain yourself from trespassing.<>

I understand... I'll be going then, Orakhan.<>

I'll be going then, Orakhan.<>

This garden feels so warm and cozy.$nThe garden inside the Imperial Castle is much flashier,$nbut it's not very comfy.$nThis is kind of old, but I wish$nthey would keep it the same.<>

This is kind of old,$nbut I wish they would keep it the same.<>

I don't like it because it looks cruddy.$nGardens from other houses look cool,$nbut this place is shoddy.<>

It's true what they say,$nkids only like the flashy stuff.$nYou don't understand the$ncomfortable beauty of small places.<>

Estell, I now know what you meant then.$nThis place is warm and cozy because$nI have lots of memories buried in it...$nThis garden keeps memories of you and me within.$nI don't want it to be ruined by Orakhan like this.<>

This garden keeps memories of you and me within.$nI don't want it to be ruined by Orakhan like this.<>

(I seem to get tired more easily as of late.$nIt's as if my body doesn't belong to me...)<>
