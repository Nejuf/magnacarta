I don't know what Unwetter is planning,$nbut Emblems are important resources for us.<>

Why did you let Schwartz purify them all?<>

I have my reasons...$nMephisto, you have changed much, to yell at me.<>

Pardon me for my rudeness.<>

No, that's fine. I'm just amused.$nTime is getting the better of me, perhaps.$nWhat really became different is,$nthe boy of back then who would trust and$naccept my words, looks into my eyes now with doubt.<>

Rose was glad that I was born again,$nbut you were different.<>

...<>

Exactly. That glare. I see you don't believe my words.<>

I... only find it odd to see you now so suddenly.$nYou have been missing for ten years, quietly...<>

Haha... Right. I suppose you're acting reasonably.<>

Of course, I know what your existence$nmeans within Vermillion.$nOur soldiers's morale rose quite a bit.<>

Hm. You will like my next move.$nIt'll be quite a fun little party.<>

Do you wish an assassination...?<>

What's with the long face?$nI thought you'd welcome it with open arms.$nYou enjoyed killing by the night in the past.<>

Who knows, even Calintz,$nwhom you are so concerned with, may come this time.$nDon't you want to settle the score with him?$nQuite a lot of jobs have been ruined thanks to him.<>

He must be quite a bother to you.<>

Do you know how strong he is...?<>

Well, I could say he has about as much talent as you.$nHowever, don't kill him should you win your fight.$nI want his talent in the future.<>

He can be used until he is done.<>

...<>

Is this person... truly Unwetter, my hero of long ago?$nI ask myself from time to time what makes$nme wonder about him. Of course, I have no answer for it.<>

I shall gather new comrades. These fools are hopeless.$nI need those with strong abilities,$nas well as my little puppets.<>
