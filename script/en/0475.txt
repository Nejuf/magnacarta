I will be reborn. Erasing the pitiful past of myself...
I will be born anew. I bet everything with this Sion,
and the past will be the price... 
From now on, I will be the person I always dreamed
of being, someone everyone will look up to.<>

Guh...!<>

Hoo... that nightmare again...<>

Soon, now.<>

It's been ten years since then.
A time I hate recalling.
I never imagined that I would come back.
To this place filled with memories,
and even greater pain... Shudelmir.<>
