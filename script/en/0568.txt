Everyone in Shudelmir talks about the Princess.$nShe's the daughter of Estell,$nwho was famous for her beauty.<>

There are some bad rumors about Estell.$nMany say she was assassinated and that$nthe assassins were a part of Vermillion.<>

I don't know what really happened,$nI don't even know where she was buried.$nThe king seemed oddly indifferent about$nher death for some reason.<>

Oh... Captain Calintz!$nWhat brings you to this place?<>

You should be busy since you're in Squad 7.$nI'm doing recon under Captain Wilhelmina.<>

Gilbert? He's a fair person, and very loyal$nto the king and queen. There are rumors that$nsay he wasn't always like that.$nBut, I don't believe them.<>

I saw a very cute girl today.$nShe had her hair rolled up,$nand wore strange clothing,$nwith a black skirt and tights on only one leg.<>

She suddenly walked over to me and started talking.$nA cute girl like her, talking to me...$nToday was my lucky day.<>

Of course, she was just asking for directions...$nBut I've never seen a girl who looked so innocent.$nShe looked as if something, or someone,$nwas on her mind. Oh well...<>
