Awaiting your order.<>

The situation?<>

Ristun civilians have mostly evacuated.
According to rumor, bandits have gone inside.
They believe they'll find treasure,
but they will simply become monsters.
There was a report of herds of monsters,
they appeared after men were said to have
gone into the ruins.<>

Is Vermillion involved...?<>

It is assumed as such.
Monsters in their normal state do not move
so actively, preferring the more shady parts
of the ruins.  The fact they went into town
suggests they are being controlled.<>

I see.<>

Start purification.
Ristun townsfolk seemed to believe
we were somehow their saviors.<>

Obviously.  They're left to starve in shelters until
they can go back to town. Do you understand
the situation fully?<>

I'm aware...
Stop acting as if I'm a spoiled child, would you?<>

I've gotten used to Schwartz and their way of life.
At least, in a sense. I was living here as though
being discharged didn't matter.
The Commanding General however, he seemed like
he accepted or enjoyed my attitude.
Seventh Team apparently receives a great deal of
resentment from the other teams.  A half-assed team.
That said, the badmouthing seems to be all 
the other teams are capable of doing.
Gossip should be ignored, though I
admit, it seems as though I can fit here.<>
