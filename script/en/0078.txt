Welcome, Commander Calintz.
I'm pleased to see the one sent at the recommendation of King Helios.<>

Let's dispense with the formality.
I'm Calintz Jerevinian.<>

Just as the rumors say, you're quite rude.
Your reputation as the Phantom of Avalanche
precedes you.  Even Ladrinne recognizes
your ability.<>

Strange... she forced me to come here.<>


I realize coming here was less than pleasant.
However, Squad 7 was recently formed and I hope
you will do your best to improve the situation.<>

Though I know well of your ability, there's likely
to be problems.  A soldier in your squad is
responsible for the last commander's retirement.
I expect your flexibility as a soldier to deal
with any problems that should occur.<>

So your idea of flexibility is
toying around with people.<>

Hmph... Schwartz is a group comprised of brute force.<>

As is to be expected of a military unit.<>

You've quite a sharp tongue.<>

Chelsea, this Schwartz Headquarters,
not your house.<>

I know that brother.<>

I'd prefer you call me Commander.<>

Yes, Commander!<>

Please introduce Calintz to
the other members of Squad 7.<>

Yes, Commander!<>
