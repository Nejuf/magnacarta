Uh, uh, save me...<>

It's alright. I've always been a goon, not knowing how to fight.<>

Uh, Ro...Roffma, Captain Calintz, please help. These guys...<>

Can I help or not...? <>

...It's hard to act like you didn't see it. If you die, nothing will happen, but if you survive, it will be a headache...<>

Ha, haha... it looks like an opportunity.<>

Whoa, you survived. I was able to get rid of it by myself anyway, but after all, this precious body would have to be used with the blood on my hands. Besides, it's your job to get rid of the monsters anyway.<>

What is it?<>

Saved by such filth, my grace has been tainted...!<>

It is a natural duty for a lowly people like you to help an aristocrat like me. It's Schwartz like us who keep you on your feet and protect you who can't even pay taxes. Isn't it?<>

This bastard...!<>

Oh, are you going to hit me? If you want to hit me, then try. Do you think a commoner like you will survive after doing that? Not only you, but your family, too. Can't do much as a ghost, can you?<>

Why, you...!<>

...!<>

Wow, what are you doing! You Jirat peasant...!<>

You're angry, but don't stoop to his level. I'm not high class, but you should know that I have Emperor Helios' backing. You have no power over me, keep it up and I will be the phantom haunting you.<>

What, what...!?<>

Listen! Keep in mind that this is a close-knit group. If I kill you now, who will know? Chelsea and Roffma are the only witnesses. And, I think these two would be willing to look the other way.<>

Are you threatening me?<>

You know damn well! So you might want to shut up! I'm getting a strong urge to cut you into two pieces.<>

Oh, uh...ok<>

Wow, that's the spirit! Everything is cool. Isn't that right, Roffma?<>

What......<>

Stop going. <>

Are you......are you covering me?<>

...I can't do such a crazy thing.<>

......Ha, haha, he's a funny guy.<>

In fact, it wasn't my concern for Roffma, but the sense of superiority somehow reminded me of Ladrinne. That's why I got upset without realizing it. I can't stand the disgust when I see those who carry such an antiquated aristocratic view as if it were a kind of medal.
Still, I was fortunate that this incident served as an opportunity to loosen the tension between Roffma and me.<>
