It's a closing order...<>

I... Was it wrong for me to go along?<>

No, I'm not trying to blame you. I don't think you were wrong.  It was the right thing to do. <>

Of course, I don't mean that I don't understand how Roffma feels. But even if Evell had my parents, I would have given the same order to seal it off.<>

I know how you feel. Anyway, the Evell gun handled it well. You'll be worn-out, let's stop for a moment to rest.<>

...Okay. <>
