Please spare me...<>

You, you're really not a monster?<>

No... I tell you, I'm not.<>

Don't be tricked!  Another monster pulled the same
trick and killed my colleagues!<>

But... hm.  Seems so human.<>

Sa, save me, please...
Spare me.  I'm no monster. Please...<>

Shut up you creep!<>

Stop!<>

...<>

How could they...!<>

Forget it.  It will be too late,
once the monster is born.<>

How is that a monster?  It's a kid.<>

Don't deny the possibility.  You know how it is.
Hurry.  It's better to get rid of the rune master.
We'll deal with the rest of this shit later.<>
