What's the situation?<>

The Second Schwartz Squad has been inside
for an hour and thirty minutes.
No further news as of yet.<>

Did they go in deep?
They should have been finished after an hour...<>

Just leave him and he'll do what be wants.<>

Don't look at me like that. 
Do you know how low we in terms of what other squads
think of the seventh squad? They think we're hobos 
who don't know their place on the social ladder.<>

On top of that, since our last captain would 
always cower from the higher-ups, 
we're treated worse than before. 
Those high and mighty freaks are 
fine without us coming to their rescue.<>

I didn't say anything...<>

What? You want a piece of this?<>

No, I'm saying that you don't have to 
go if you don't want to. But since I'm
going, either you keep a lookout, or you
return to headquarters or whatever.
Although, if you get kicked out of 
Schwartz because of this, it's your loss.<>

Dammit...<>
