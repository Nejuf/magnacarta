You sure there is an awesome treasure here?$nWe've been looking around here for awhile now.<>

There must be. They say those ancient folks lived$nin castles that were covered in gold and silver.<>

What kind of fool would take a saying$nlike that literally, besides you?<>

Aha, this could be it. Should I go first?$nYou all be careful not to be blinded by gleaming gold.<>

Your haiku sucks,$njust shut up and get in there already.<>
