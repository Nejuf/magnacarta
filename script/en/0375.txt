Really now. Must be great to be the Commander,
arriving late to the first meeting and everything.<>

That is why an apology was made.<>

How many times is it going to take until
resignati... annoying as hell.<>

You, look here.<>

What do you take me for?<>

I may not look it, but I'm the Commander of Squad Two.
Don't you think the least amount of
courtesy should be kept here?<>

Keep the courtesy first yourself.<>

All I hear is whining, I wasn't even introduced yet.<>

I was about to apologize and make up,
but you just ruined it.<>

Is that so?<>

Luchielu Chelsea Descralda.<>

I lead Squad Two as the Commander.
You're Calintz Jerevinian, correct?<>

The one from Squad Seven?<>

Then... you must be General Gilbert's sister...<>

Adopted.<>

There's no blood relation between us,
so you don't need to kiss ass.<>

Flattering someone else doesn't suit me.<>

One stubborn child after another today...<>

(...)<>

Shut up and just follow along.<>

Schwartz Storm was the place I came to,
or I suppose was chased to, no thanks to Ladrinne.<>

I knew from the beginning that I 
wasn't going to be welcome here.<>

I didn't really care to be friendly either.<>

Only King Helios and my relationship to him
have caused me any problems thus far.<>
