We're escorting the empress...<>

It couldn't be helped,$nthis was direct request from his highness.<>

Are we going to be okay,$nshowing up at a dance party like this?$nEveryone there is talking behind our backs.<>

Pity, but we need to act exactly as we$nwere ordered in situations like this.<>

Tell me something I don't know.<>

Felicia, is it really okay to bring$nthe kid somewhere like this? <>

The kid doesn't know anything,$nnot even the fact that he belongs to Schwartz.<>

Well, if no one knows that Squad 7$nis guarding the empress that day,$nwe'll just blend in with the regular guards,$nand carry on as if we aren't Schwartz.<>

Still, I don't like this.$nSchwartz has poor relations with the empress,$nand we're on guard duty despite that...$nIt's too easy for misunderstandings to occur.<>

Our positions are as follows:$nChelsea and I go inside the Orakhan,$nand Roffma and Felicia are to patrol outside.$nSo all Felicia needs to do is watch from Roffma's side.<>

Huh? Why would Roffma be coupled with Felicia?<>

You and I know at least a bit about manners.$nRoffma and Felicia, on the other hand,$ndon't know the first thing about it.$nThey'll be on our ass if someone makes mistakes inside.<>

Eh, I suppose that's true...<>

...?<>
