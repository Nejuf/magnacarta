It should be around here somewhere...<>

It was here...
a picture of my family was hanging on this wall.
I can barely remember now that it's gone.
All the valuables in the house were probably sold
somewhere when the house burnt down. Or stolen...<>

Now... I can't even remember my own parents anymore.<>
