I sent a letter to Ruvalen...$nThat day, we planned to meet at the Holy Grounds.$nI have to tell him not go come...$nnow there's no way to let him know.<>

Everything's done. Finally I'm free...<>

You were here?<>

Um, Your, Your Majesty...<>

Why do you look as...?<>

That's not it, I was...<>

You're something, Estell.$nOn the surface you look like an angel,$nbut actually you're a devil on the inside.$nYeah, that's why I like you.$nBecause I'm the shameless bastard who$nbrought about my motherland's ruin.$nAfter all, we meet in groups, don't we?<>

Your Highness...<>

That day, were you going to meet Vermillion$nat the Holy Grounds? Good, you're paying attention.$nEven if you don't go, we're still going to catch that$nbastard. At the palace, those who cause misery are$npunished. All the accomplices will be killed together...$nWe even afford them a choice in how they wish to die.<>

Your Majesty, this is the first time that$nI've seen you like this. Needless to say,$nI knew that Krois was the one who was behind$nthe downfall, but he was always so kind and gentle,$nI could have never guessed that he had that$nkind of mask on.$nI didn't see it in him,that murderous spirit...

Estell... died becouse of me.$nBecause I was obstinate she was forced to show$nher true self.$nThough I have a guilty conscience now,$nin the Imperial Family, those with power can't$nhelp but keep people at a distance.$nI know that truth too well... it couldn't be helped.$nEstell was a stepping stone that I$nhad to step on so that I could move on... <>
