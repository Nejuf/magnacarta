Come on in, Calintz.
I've gotten the letter from Emperor Helios.<>

Not much to talk about. I'm Calintz Jerevinian.<>

Hm, hm, just as I've heard. They say 
you're quite stand-offish with others.
The "Phantom of Avalanche" moniker is well known
amongst the royal guards. Even Ladrinne
acknowledges your skill.<>

(Does she... funny. She should acknoledge that
she likes to manipulate others instead.)<>

Well, I don't imagine this is the best situation for
your appointment to Squad Seven. It was just formed,
and we don't have many men as it is. Do the best with
what you've got I suppose.<>

I went over the report about you. Your thinking seems
flexible compared to an average soldier's. Thus,
you should be suitable to Squad Seven.<>

I guess flexible is a nice of way of referring
to someone who does whatever they feel like doing.<>

Ahem... in Schwartz you will probably fight more
than in your guard duty days. I look forward to
seeing your skills on the battlefield.<>

I'm sure all the fighting will be just
as boring as it always has been.<>

You sure like to twist words around, son.<>

Chelsea, this is the Schwartz headquarters, not home.<>

I know, brother.<>

I'd rather you call me by my title.<>

Yessir, commander general, sir.<>

...
Go introduce Calintz to the other Squad members.<>

Yessir, commander general, sir.<>

...<>
