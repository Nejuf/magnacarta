What are you doing... Estell?<>

Heh?  What are you talking about?<>

After you went back...
You were talking about strange
things with father...
I don't honestly know what you do...<>

Nothing big.  Something grown ups do, okay?<>

Don't treat me like a kid.  I'm over ten already.<>

Aww, you grew up so much, didn't you, big guy?<>

Cheh...<>

Calintz...
I want you to grow without knowing too much.
That way you'll be happy after all this is over.
You will be, won't you?  I can only wish for
that small happiness.<>

What are you talking about?<>

Don't think too much about it.<>

Adora... are you up now?<>

Calintz...<>

Good, you scared me because you didn't
wake up right away.<>

Mm... Calintz.  I had a weird dream.<>

...?<>

There was a child version of Calintz.
Then I had another dream about Estell.
It's been a while so I should have been happy,
but all I felt was sadness.  There were so
many things that bothered the spirit.
I couldn't understand, but when the bad
things ended, Calintz lived happily.
But... what are those bad things?
What made Estell feel so conflicted?
I always saw happiness on that face.<>

I want to know too...
About Estell.  I don't know either, why she
died like that or how much pain she felt on
the inside, smiling on the outside.<>

When I remember Estell,
I only recall her final moments.
There were a lot of happy times.
But that sad face, that face before
she falls is the only thing I can see.
And...
That damned shadow of Unwetter,
who will face my judgement.<>
