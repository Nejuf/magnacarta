Let's get the hell out of here.<>

What are you after? Why are you helping us?<>

I've given you my reasons already.<>

Ferenan...<>

Rose, I trust that you did not betray us.<>

Yeah...<>

So everyone gets involved in the end...<>

Quit with that kind of talk.
We decided this after heavy debate,
so I won't hear your whining.<>

We'll talk later.
We need to hide for now.<>

We'll move "there."<>
