Ugh.<>

Weldrim Grasslands - Evell<>

Hey, you're part of Schwartz, right? Ever heard of Roffma? He's my brother. He told me that he was gonna join Schwartz.<>

Roffma played with us every day before he went to Shudelmir. He also scared off all the bad guys for us, too.<>

Our neighborhood is part of the slums, and there's always bad guys hiding. So it's dangerous to go out at night.<>

Really, now... Where did Lucy go again? Did the children take Lucy with them to the forest? I'm getting tired o' looking for them.<>

Our town may be poor, and every day is a struggle, but the people here are good folks. Everyone tries to help each other...<>

But, still, no matter how hard we try, folks are still dieing of hunger, with nowhere to go. That's what happens in the slums... <>

Sigh. Will I ever be able to get out of here, even if I work hard my whole life? I wish I could live like a nobleman, just for a single day...<>

Anyway you see it, this world is unfair. Them stuck up, filthy goons get all the money, and the power too...<>

Still, there are times when the Scaramouche come here. They may be bandits, but they're nice bandits. Them Scaramouche. They're a hundred, no a THOUSAND times better than the kid Emperor we got now. Word is that the Emperor and the Empress ain't so close. That Empress woman should just go all the way and take the crown.<>

Evell folks are able to survive thanks to the Weldrim Grasslands. There's beasts to hunt, herbal medicines to dig, and such... Our problem is that people don't come here to the slums. To sell any o' the spoils we gotta travel far, and that's hard.<>

Since Roffma left, his sister Joy is the one children 'round here turn to. Roffma left only 'cause o' his siblings...well, he calls 'em his siblings, but he took 'em all in like an orphanage.<>

Don't get me wrong, we truly appreciate him and Joy. I'm just worried. How will they get enough food...<>

Everybody in the rich towns says Vermillion unleashed monsters there to wreak havoc.  I guess that's one thing we got going for us in the slums.<>

Vermillion doesn't touch us poor folks. I saw someone who was attacked by one of those monsters... It was terrible, I never want to die like that...<>

I understand how the Vermillion guys feel. With how King Clive destroyed their homeland of Krois. But King Clive's mother was from Krois, so how could he stand to destroy his mother's homeland like that?  And killed his uncle, no less!<>
