This time, a herd of monsters have appeared
at Sihara Forst at Ruminez, south from here.
It is reported that Vermillion's Rune Masters
are inciting these beasts, warping them into monsters.<>

...<>

They still have Rune Masters?<>

They take anyone who shows potential as Rune Master,
without exception.  It's suspected that in Shudelmir,
nearly half of the cases dealing with disappearances
of civilians are connected to Vermillion.<>

This is the first mission with Rose.
Though you were a part of Vermillion,
now that you are part of Squad Seven,
please follow Calintz's orders carefully.<>

Shut your hole.<>

Hoo, you seem quite angry.<>

I'll say.  She's pissed off.  By the way,
why is it so hard to see the general's face now?
It's as if mission briefing has become your job.<>

He's away for private reasons it seems.
He's always busy anyway.<>

...?<>
