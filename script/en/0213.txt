I am still the same... come visit the palace some day.
I want you to meet my daughter, Juclecia.  Be a
good brother for her, will you?  She's only a little
baby now, but if she takes after me, she'll be quite
the tomboy.<>

I recall the days spent at the garden.
Someday I will go back there.  Then I can
have back that nostalgic past.
We can make lots of fun memories and be happy...<>

Estell...<>

Father... give... give it back.<>

Father?  Was that my father's appearance?
I... he's hard to recall.  The father in
my memory... I can only see his back.
The type of man to put work over his son.<>
