A, aaah, S, Spare me...<>

What a sight. Where did that arrogance go?$nI guess the reality is$nthat you couldn't fight at all.<>

R, Ro, Roffma, Calintz, help me.$nThese wretched infidels...<>

Do we feel like helping, or not? <>

We can't leave him after we saw what happened.$nNothing's going to happen if he dies,$nbut he'll be a headache if he survives.<>

Ha haha... That's so you.<>

Sigh, I'm alive.$nWell, it wasn't much danger to begin with,$nbut I shouldn't dirty my$nbeautiful hands with filthy blood.$nSlaying monsters is your job anyway.<>

What the hell?<>

You dare...!?!<>

It's your born duty as a peon$nto assist a noble like myself.$nWe Schwartz noblemen restrain ourselves to take$ncare of penniless grunts such as yourselves,$nisn't that right?<>

How dare you...!<>

Ha, plan to use your fist? Hit me all you want.$nPeasants like you think you can survive such crimes?$nYour family won't be safe either.$nYou're too young to be fish food, don't you agree?<>

You, You son of a...!<>

...!<>

Ha, How dare you! You boorish Sirat wretch...!<>

Yeah, and your point being?$nI'll take you one on one if you want.$nAt any rate, you better realize that even$nif I am from the countryside,$nI have Emperor Helios on my side.$nI could live like you, no problem.$nI just choose not to be a$nshameless piece of walking trash.<>

W, What...!?<>

Wake up! We're in the middle of danger.$nNo one's going to complain even if you end up dead.$nSo long as Chelsea and Roffma keep you quiet at least.$nI'm pretty sure neither of them can$nstand the sight of you anyway.<>

I, is that a threat?<>

So now you understand. Keep your mouth shut.$nI should cut the skin off your face$nand bury you in a pile of shit,$nbut that would hardly satiate my disgust.<>

!!<>

Heh, go leader! You told him good.$nIsn't that right, Roffma?<>

Well...<>

It's time to leave.<>

You... did that for me?<>

You think I'd be doing such an insane thing?<>

Ha haha, you oddball.<>

(I suppose I did act for Roffma,$nbut it felt more like Ladrinne's arrogance than Loclei's.$nThat's what made me lose control.$nI'm nauseated by the sickeningly ill-natured$nnoblemen and the way they think.$nI was rather glad that this eased Roffma a bit.)<>
