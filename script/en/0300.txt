Calintz... are you feeling better?  You look sick.<>

It's okay...<>

Really... we're done for.
Joker told me.  We'll be executed.<>

...<>

Strange, I'm not scared.  I don't know what dying
feels like... but it'll only hurt for a moment.
I just feel... sad.
I wanted to hang out with you more.<>

Why didn't you tell me that you were Juclesia?
If I knew about it earlier,
I could have prevented this.<>

I... I knew I was playing the fake.  You know,
someone who has to leave... so I couldn't tell you.
I thought I shouldn't be caught.  That's why I didn't
say anything.  I really wanted to see you.
Sorry...<>

You lived as Juclesia for... over a decade?<>

I suppose so... when I saw you for the first time,
I felt as if I woke up from some kind of long dream...
Memories of Estell that you showed me felt so...
familiar. I fantasized about getting back
to my true self, by seeing you.<>

But I was really only beholden to Juclesia's shadow.
To be like her, I felt my memories being wiped away.
But Juclesia is a part of me... and the one who
played her is also me.  So... I don't know
what I lived for until now... I feel so empty.<>

Both of you get out.  It's time.<>

Oh...!<>

...<>
