Congratulations, you rescued Gend well.<>

Gend did most of the work,
I didn't do squat.<>

Your choice of words... If your superior didn't
let them slide, you could easily be dishonorably
discharged. I suppose I see your skill, however.<>

Don't hesitate to discharge someone like me,
whenever you like. It's not like I'll miss being
part of Schwartz. I'll go back and get some rest.<>

I thought as much. He's hard to tame. Just as
problematic now as he was when he was in the
Sirat royal court.<>

He thinks he's good at provoking people.<>

That's how he got your interest. All so sudden,
though. I hear you want to transfer to Squad Seven?<>

Squad Two's hard to get along with. We're all nobles,
but you know, they're not going to be friendly with
an adopted noble. Plus it's full of old people.
A newbie like myself can't grow in that environment...
That's why I thought Squad Seven would be more
suitable for me. There, at least I won't have
to keep up my manners. I can do what I want to do.<>

You won't regret your decision...?<>

Of course not. Calintz is interesting too.
He complains a lot, but he seems a little
different on the inside.<>

After being injured and all... Little monsters like
those, other guys would have made us deal with them.
He's always spewing nonsense, but really...
well, he's an odd person.<>

...?<>
