I need to stop thinking out loud. Geez.<>

Huh, what are you doing here?<>

Can't you tell!? Don't just sit there, help me up!<>

Dear, why would I?$nDo you remember what you said to$nme when I was like this a bit ago?$nStick your butt up higher whydoncha, I believe?<>

Sh... That was long ago...<>

Long ago? Hooo, you still have some mouth.$nYou don't even have a bro to tell on,$nwhat are you going to do about it?<>

You little...<>

Hoo, you should have came out$njust like that from the start.<>

What? You did the same thing to me.$nNow you're calling me out?  You're so crude.<>

I'll just let this slide, yeah, slide.<>

Fine...$nLooking for Calintz is first, I'll let it go for now.<>

That is...$nI think she got carried off in some other direction...$nWe better hurry.$nThis place, I don't know how stable it is...<>

It's just my luck to pair up with a$nuseless idiot like this.$nHey, can't you move any faster?$nI'm in a hurry.<>

Come on, a little help.$nYou don't want a healthy comrade to die, do you?<>
