What are you doing here,
and with such anger on your face?<>

I need to know.
Is all the work, all the gathering,
is all of this for Magna Carta?<>

So you've learned of it.<>

Do you not realize the power that ceremony is capable 
of?  The Magna Carta may not just stop at destroying 
the Empire. It may destroy all of Shudelmir, no, 
it may destroy the entirety of the continent.<>

Shudelmir, no, it may destroy the entirety of the continent.<>

The imperial court will kneel only to such power.<>

This is no mere joke!
I do not wish for the reconstruction of Krois 
if it ruins the world as we know it.
Do you wish for this world to cease to exist?<>

You underestimate the current Empire.
Clive is a man who wiped out your motherland.
You do not understand what he is capable of.<>
