You're finally here.<>

...<>

Now, I'm all yours. Don't you wish to kill me?<>

Exactly as you've done for me.<>

Then what are you going to threaten me with,
for such a price?<>

Let go of my colleagues, for that,
you'll leave with a head on your shoulders.<>

Well, do you suppose I'll listen to that?
I've done what I desired.  It's too bad that I
won't get to see your execution...
You're no longer part of Sirat.<>

You are truly... a demon.  Heart and soul.
It is unbelievable that you care so earnestly
for Razell.  Isn't the child just your tool?<>

As if you deserved to talk that way.
You know nothing of me.<>

Don't act as if you are the lone actress of some
tragic play.  You as well... know nothing
of what I feel as I came here.<>

Kill me now.  I've no intention of granting your wish.<>

...<>

What's the matter?  Too scared?<>

T, Tristan...!?<>

How do you know that name...?<>

No... this man... is my father...?<>

You... How do you know of Tristan?<>

Tristan is... my father...?<>

Your father is Ropeiden. Tristan is...<>
