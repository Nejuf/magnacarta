Are you telling me the truth...?<>

Wun Veto has extremely excessive desire.  He will try
to rule the entire continent with the power of 
Magna Carta.  Even if the empire stops fighting back.
I want no man of such ambition and power.  The reason
Crois no longer exists was because of its desire to
attain greater glory than the Empire.<>

Wun Veto seems to have a torrid history with the
Empire.  Is that his reason for this obsessive war?<>

His goal doesn't stop at revenge or even the
reconstruction of Crois.  I suspect he actually
wishes for unification of the entire continent.
Even Vermillion is little more than a tool for him.<>

Do other members know about this?  
Should we look for help from others?<>

That's not a sound plan.  Too many men ally themselves
with Wun Veto.  With even a slight mistake, there is
the danger of being accused as a traitor, ruining
everything.  Still, there are ways to prevent
Magna Carta.  As long as Wun Veto does not obtain
all of the Sion, he cannot hope to enact his plan.<>

Then...<>

Hand me one of the Sions you have.
Now if I disappear for a while, even Wun Veto
will not be able to do anything.  I can't just
stand around and watch him try to "regain" peace
by himself.<>

Is this really alright?<>

Wun Veto knows nothing about it, Estell.  You do
not want this world to be wiped out.  Even if you do,
we must stop him from using Vermillion as a means
for his revenge.  This must stop.<>

I agree.<>
