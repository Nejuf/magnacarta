Shit, what the hell is this?
Do they think we're some house guard dogs? 
They want us to just stand here like buncha fools?<>

Getting a little break doesn't suit you? 
I figured you would love it.<>

Our Little Miss Precious just wants to fool around.<>

Humph, you'd be taking a nap if we weren't on a mission, 
you clown. You just want to see the empress pretty
badly on the inside, I bet?<>

It's a much better view than 
looking at your pair of flat walls.<>

What did you say?<>

I'm past the state of being tired of them fighting...<>

Roffma, wake up and take a good look, 
why doncha? It's her highness passing.<>

Estell...<>

Really reminds me of Estell, that girl. 
Of course, she is Estell's only daughter.
However, around her...
I felt an odd aura.
Something was odd, even considering that 
she was basically trapped in Elder
by herself for her childhood.<>

Your majesty, at the risk of being rude, 
it's better to stay inside...
Somthing could happen at any moment.<>

I'm sorry. To finally meet my sister...
My mind is uneasy in excitement.<>

I wish you could meet her highness
quickly more than anyone else.<>

It's her highness, your majesty.<>

My sister...<>

I am honored to pass my greetings to your highness. 
I, Schwartz Storm Squad 1 leader Drake Siden Ruvalen, 
shall lead your highness to his majesty, who has come 
here himself to meet you in person.<>

Sister...<>

It's an honor, your majesty.<>

In truth... You are really my sister Juclecia?<>

Yes. I am truly honored to greet you. 
You even came by yourself to see me...<>

No no, you're my only sister. 
Let's move to the castle first. 
You must be tired from the long trip? 
We'll rest there.<>

You have done well to guide her here.
Has anything happened?<>

Of course not, it was I who guarded her.<>
