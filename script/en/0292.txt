All the nobles who took the lead in Marhakatte with Orakhan Willright to lend their strength to this conspiracy were arrested. Now I feel relieved.<>

......I don't know why this happened. I wasn't hoping for something like this. There's nothing wrong with that girl named Adora. Only the crime of being used...<>

I really don't understand. Who's side are you on now? It was Sir Gilbert who was on execution list.<>

......So why the hell did Calintz do that? And to be caught so stupidly... If he had real intent, he couldn't have been caught so easily. No matter how much I think about it...<>

There's nothing more to think about. The important thing is that the Ernst family's governmental power is now completely ended. For the time being, you will assume the position of provisional regent. Opinions may vary as to what to do in the future, but in the end I think you, the Bi-ere Orakhan, will remain as regent.<>

......<>

You don't have to feel guilty, Gilbert. You have everything in your hands. Anyway, from the beginning, you were expecting Marhakatte to be like this.<>

Well, I've been patiently trying to root out the traitorous forces, but...
It would be better to execute everyone as an example. So that there will never be any vain thoughts again...<>

Calintz's involvement still feels odd. That he would... For him to plan this with Willright, seems like a leap.<>

You are too trusting. It's amazing how you've been keeping the Orakhan seat until now. <>
