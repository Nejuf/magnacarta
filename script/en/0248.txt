Rose, you disappoint me to the end.
Joining Schwartz... did she turn her back on us?<>

There is no possibility of Rose betraying us,
Wun Veto.  Though she is from Crois, she is
part of Vermillion.<>

If that is so, what's the meaning of this
report about her being part of Schwartz?
There is no other explanation aside from
acquiring her talents after cornering her.<>

I want to trust Rose.<>

Leading Vermillion demands clear and serene thought.
You refuse assassination, and hate putting your men
on the front lines.  What can be done if you cannot
approve of sacrificing anything?  Will you throw
yourself into the pit and claim some false sense
of leadership?  The entire organization will fall
with such thinking.<>

Will you throw yourself into the pit
and claim some false sense of leadership?
The entire organization will fall
with such thinking.<>
Are you going to throw yourself into flamehole in the sense of false leadership? If that happens, so will the entire organization.
But...<>

It is fortunate that Rose held no useful information.
It would have leaked to Schwartz otherwise.  That's
all I shall say.  Prepare for the arrival of
our guest, Mephisto.<>

Can this man truly be the Wun Veto I've admired...?
Something's changed about him.<>
