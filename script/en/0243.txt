Adora, finish the job.<>

Stop...<>

Why?  Does she remind you of something?<>

Do whatever you want...<>

That... idiot.<>

Pardon?<>

...!<>

I suppose we're back to square one then?<>

...<>

Weren't you planning to kill someone?<>

Dammit...<>

You cannot match me.<>

Shit...<>

Amusing that you keep challenging me,
even after losing every time.
Do yourself a favor and get a better job.<>

...<>

Our new objective is to clear the runes
and report back to headquarters.<>

Go do that now.  I'll take this goon.<>

Yeah, got it.<>
