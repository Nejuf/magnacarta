Chelsea?<>

Oops, do you like being trapped? You know, this look really doesn't suit you.  It would be a much better look for Ladrinne.<>

Calintz... was tortured... he hasn't woken up yet. <>

......<>

Torture...? What more is there to find out? All those involved have already been arrested.<>

I don't know......<>

My brother is also really stumped. He knows that Calintz is not a murderer, but he is helpless because he has no evidence. With how clever Calintz is, he wouldn't have been caught if he had done it. Obviously someone cheated.<>

But there are people who clearly saw Calintz do it. However, it is quite questionable to see him caught like this. If someone manipulated him...<>

Ladrinne is the only one would do that. My brother is not that kind of person.<>

Damn, there's no evidence, so there's no way to convince people.<>

So... what are we going to do now?<>

That's...<>

The execution will be in two days... there's already word all over Shudelmir. <>

Joker!<>

I was just telling the truth like it is. Besides, you already know that you can't overturn it.<>

Damn... this is definitely wrong no matter what!<>
