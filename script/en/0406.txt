It's great that we didn't suffer huge losses,
and even though it was a small hideout,
we now have a Sion Channeler in our hands.<>

Too bad we missed Rose though.
Moreover... will you accept Felicia to your team?<>

It's better to have a quiet kid who listens than two
idiots who quarrel with each other all the time.<>

Joker wanted this as well,
so there shouldn't be any problem.<>

We've made a temporary alliance with Joker,
as he is the only leader of the Scaramouche.<>

I think he knows we're not letting him go home free.<>

Joker's attached to Felicia, so it's not likely
he'll try anything that would endanger her.<>
