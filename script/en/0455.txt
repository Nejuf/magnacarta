It's been a long time, Juclesia<>

I'm glad to see you in the castle again.<>

It has been a long time, your higness.<>

You've grown to be quite beautiful.<>

Thanks to you. It's been a long while 
since I left here, my birthplace.
I'm glad everyone accepts me kindly.<>

Hoho, that's right.<>

(There's no need for such an
insincere smile, mighty Empress.<>

The late Emperor wanted to see his only daughter...
It's really too bad that he passed
away without being able to do so.
I wanted to call you, yet he
ordered me to not do so...<>

Nevermind. I would rather not talk about it.
My father may have forsaken me, but my dear
brother summoned me here. It's quite enough.<>

Yes. Much has happened today. Don't you worry
about it. Go get some rest. We've prepared
extra guards. There's nothing to worry about.<>

I appreciate your thoughtfulness, highness.<>

I used to be... so close with Juclesia's mother.
Usually when the second wives show, most would feel
jealous of them, yet it was the first time I met
such a beautiful and kind woman. I made it through
difficult times in the castle thanks to her.
For such a woman to leave... a sad thing.<>

You weren't jealous...? You caused her death!
I will unveil your filthy mask someday.<>

Excuse me, I shouldn't have said anything.
Go rest now, Juclesia.<>

I will not be played with like I was ten years ago.
I'm no longer scared and ignorant, and I will not 
be driven out of the castle again. I will get
back all that I've lost... dear, dear Empress.<>
