Do you think our actions were just?<>

To bring Joker back in such a condition
is unreasonable.  However, he's probably
not enough of a fool to die.  Although,
there's not much we do about that.<>

What is Felicia's condition?<>

Hard to say,
it's difficult to
persuade silent soldiers.<>

Scaramouche was never an organization that
would have lasted long to begin with.  There
were spies within and Vermillion likely
infiltrated the group as well.<>

What will be done to Joker?
I suppose Felicia will help us with him?<>

I figured you would ask about him.
Other squads are organized by their social rank,
but Squad 7 is an exception.<>

I suppose that's a result of purification
needing to be done by those with
a stronger spiritual affinity?<>

So you know.<>

I've always been able to perceive runes well.
I suppose that's a natural ability.  There's no
need to explain Felicia, as her Sion Channeler status
gives her away.  I suspect Chelsea was adopted
because of the same reason, a strong spiritual
affinity.  Even Roffma, who is by far the weakest
among us, has a spiritual affinity far
stronger than an average man.<>

Purification is our highest priority.
Vermillion is not simply disturbing Carta.
Those stones are not just treasures from the past.<>

Their original purpose is to seal this world,
a world the ancients destroyed and departed,
a world consumed by evils.<>

...<>

This continent used to be a vicious realm
of beasts and monsters.  Humans could not
survive in such conditions.  At least,
not until roughly a thousand years ago.
According to research, when the runes in
the sealed relics were destroyed, this
world once again came into being.<>

That's the reality.
We're just tools for 
that ancient war.<>

Your spiritual affinity increases as you face 
difficult battles, head on.  Squad 7's duty is 
clearing for that reason.  The reason everyone is 
of low status...  Helios himself likely wishes 
that you will focus on purification.  
I have no doubt.
To that end, he sees it as a small sacrifice
to save the people on this fragile Earth.<>

(This impudence is what they would refer to
as thousand-year old serpents muttering.
He spews words but... I find
nothing sincere about his face.)<>

Come now, don't stare at me like that.
Schwartz Storm exists, after all, for 
the peace of this city.<>

Unfortunately for us however, seals are still here.
Perfectly normal creatures turn into monsters
prove their existence.  Because of the secret
of the world's sealing, purifications have
occurred since long ago.<>
