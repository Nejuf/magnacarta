From today, I'll be in the team.$nCome on, give me a warm welcome.<>

The hell...?<>

There was no need to disapprove Chelsea,$nbecause she insisted on being here.<>

I thought she would have been more useful than a certain$nsomeone here who doesn't understand orders.$nOn top of that, Chelsea's got battle skills too.<>

What good is a snotty brat like that in this team!?<>

I think it's good for this beautiful woman to join.$nTeams with smelly boys alone are gross.<>

Flat-ass, like you're counted as a female.<>

Muscle heads like you don't$ncount as males either gramps...<>

What...?<>

Hoo... Quite the change,$nand just for adding another person too.<>
