Calintz Jerevinian, convicted for the murder of the
Emperor of the great empire and his own mother, and
Adora, who is guilty for attempted usurpation
of the throne, will now be executed here.<>

Calintz... are we going to die?<>

I'm sorry...<>

No... I'm okay.  But I'm kind of...
I'm a little scared.  It'll be over soon,
but... it's frightening.<>

Adora...<>

Do you, the condemned, have any final words?<>

No, I don't...<>

...<>

Then we will continue with the execution.<>

Mephisto...!<>

How outrageous, he's ruined the trial.<>

I can't have these two die like this.
Even without proof, they're the victims here.
I will take care of this matter my way, brother.<>

Look, Calintz, you all right?<>

You guys... why did you...?<>

Shit, that's my line.  What can I do?
I came here to see how your ass dies,
but my feet moved on their own.<>

Fool.<>

You're going along with this?<>

Mephisto... what's the meaning of this?
Aren't you directly opposed to Schwartz?<>

I couldn't just stand and watch. To be used and
thrown away when she's no longer useful...
I don't want to witness anyone becoming a victim
of meaningless power struggles amongst nobility.<>

So that's how it is.
This is not what I wish for,
but there is no other option.<>

Arrest every one of these men.<>
