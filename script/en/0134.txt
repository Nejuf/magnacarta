Recently, monsters have been reported$nnear the northern Ristun border. <>

Do you think is Vermillion is planning of something again?<>

I think so.<>

Even monsters take time to grow,$nbut the way in which huge, fully grown herds showed up,$nit doesn't seem realistic.$nIt could be said that magical runes have turned$nnormal beasts into ogres and monsters.<>

Which could lead yet another Sion.<>

Currently, Shupelonde members in the region have$nset up barricades to prevent civilian entrance.$nCalintz, go ahead and get the details,$nthen purify the Sion.<>

Yes, sir.<>

Members of Squad 7 are usually$nin charge of monsters, or double as$nassistants for other teams. It is needed however$nas a training exercise to survive Squad 7,$nin a way. Part of the reason we've kept Roffma was$nthat he was needed for the secret job of the$nSquad 7, the purifications.<>

You use quite a lot of Carta in battle.$nCarta itself only lasts for a short period of time,$nunleashing a great deal of power.$nSion, which is a kind of carriage that can hold Carta,$nsurrounds Carta that needs to be combined$nwith other Carta to create that power.<>

So you're saying that those Rune Stones$nyou see in ruins are Sion of some sort.<>

Those stones, compared to normal Sion,$nare able to hold more Carta.$nThe people of ancient cultures were said$nto be able to create new magic spells$nwith the Rune Stones.$nThey would transfer Carta from the stones$nto the bodies of a living being,$nwhich was called a Spirit Seal.<>

I've heard about that.$nIt's possible to turn normal,$nfully human beings into monsters after the process,$nusing Carta from monsters.$nEven though the Seal has to be incredibly$npowerful and accurate to make that possible.<>

Exactly. Rune Stones can affect things by themselves too.$nWe get reports of plants or insects becoming abnormally$nlarge near places where stones reside.$nThis is under the premises that the subjects$nwere near them for a long time.<>

I hear about Sions sometimes, who are they exactly?<>

A Sion was originally a legitimate career,$nrespected in ancient cultures.$nTheir specialty was amplifying the power$nof the Rune Stones and Spirit Seals.$nSions were thought to have been lost,$nas no one passed down the$nknowledge of the ancient practices...$nbut Vermillion has resurrected Sions.$nWe suspect that's why there have been so$nmany monsters in cities, Vermillion shamanists$nmust be holding Seals in old ruins$nthat have Rune Stones.<>

It's so nice that we get to take care of those monsters.<>

Don't be so cynical. I appreciate your accomplishments.$nYou have to understand that there is no end$nto killing monsters. Our focus needs to be the Sions.$nThey're creating monsters infinitely from beasts and humans.<>

We've been researching ancient records,$nand those lead us to Purification,$nremoving Carta from the Rune Stones.$nIt doesn't matter how great they are,$nwithout Carta they're nothing but stones.$nThere is also some good news,$nwriting Carta on the stones to turn$nthem into Rune Stones is gone,$nand we are the only ones who know about Purification.<>

Even if Vermillion knows about Sions,$nthey won't be able to do much with$nRune Stones lacking Carta.<>
