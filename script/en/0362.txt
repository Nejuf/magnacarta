I am...
I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius, I am a genius<>

Obviously... I was told that it was around here.<>

Ah, here it is.<>

How to get inside...?<>

Why the hell is this place such a maze?<>

Shouldn't we have turned left before?<>

What are you talking about? Didn't you hear what he said earlier?<>

That was the opposite direction according to the map we bought from the airport, though.<>

Fine. We'll use those folks over there as our guide.<>

Where are you headed?<>

Huh? Hey... Is this girl floating?<>

... <>

He... Hey! We're going to Perusso Laboratories!!<>

Oh, Perusso? It's here, right here!<>

Re... Really?<>

See? Told you! Folks who live around the region give out the best directions!<>

That's odd... You sure this is it?<>

I'm telling you! You see those guards? It's inside. Well... The guards are kind of unfriendly, and they're bad people. So, they'll probably give you hell before you can even get in.<>

If that's the case, leave it to me!<>

Christian! Wait!<>

Who the hell are you, and what is your business?<>

I came to meet your boss.<>

This fool's out of his mind.<>

Forget them. They'll go back.<>

What's the matter with you? To be so inconsiderate...<>

Eh... This son of a bitch is giving me attitude! You, tell your boss to come out!!! We got a victim of his trickery right here!<>

Christian!<>

How... How dare you foulmouth our lord!
Come on! Get out, all of you! Or I'll fix that attitude of yours!<>

Anyway, the data in this logbook is quite corrupted... so virtually everything we want to know has been erased.
After so much trouble to get the original copy...<>

Could it be, that the same guys who blew up the black box data did this too?<>

That's a possibility.<>

Most of contract we got now is destroyed, and judging from the signatures, the one who submitted the request to the Strikers seems to be the manager of Perusso Laboratories.<>

That means that bastard was the one who ordered to take us from Light Bringer because he felt like it?<>

Yes, sir. Unfortunately, though, the data which specifies the location we were taken from isn't there. That place could be where Light Bringer is.<>

Has it all been erased?<>

Yes... according to this written document of formal request, study data was asked to be moved to Perusso Laboratories. That's why the Strikers was carrying the experiment data inside Blue Bird to Perusso.<>

Experiment data...? That expression kinda creeps me out. It makes it sound like our bodies are for disections or something.<>

Experiment data, hmm...... I agree, there's something odd about it. I'm glad at least our destination is definite.<>

Yes. There's even a detailed address for the laboratory here.<>

Well then, all we need to do is to ask that laboratory manager. Since he asked us to carry the Light Bringer like the jackass he is, he must know where Light Bringer is, too.<>

That's true but we don't know if he'll be so easy and cooperative. Who knows, he could recognize our plan and even do something to interfere.<>

Right. We better act as carefully as we can. For now since we're members of Strikers, we should pose as flight attendees of the Blue Bird so we can talk to the laboratory manager. <>
