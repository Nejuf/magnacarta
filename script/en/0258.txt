I didn't expect you to come here yourself.
I realize now how determined you are.
I hope you will pardon me, for 
I failed to treat you accordingly.<>

Pardon me, for I failed to treat you accordingly.<>

I wouldn't have come if
I cared about such trivial things.<>

On that day I looked for you.  I felt you were
a man of ambition, Sir Mephisto.  It's an old saying,
"men of valor recognize one another."<>

The biggest obstacle to my plan is Schwartz Storm.
I've persuaded many of the noblemen to help me,
but oddly the Emperor and his family have not accepted
many men.  It has led to many enemies in the shadows.
Gilbert will be a problem.  His elite, the Schwartz,
are a rather large liability, to put it lightly.
From what I understand, the only men who can fight
them head on are your men.  Your Vermillion.  Schwartz
is trying to root you out though.  So I suppose it
will not be difficult for you to find them.<>

As long as they remain in Shudelmir,
I cannot make progress.<>

What will you offer us?  To be frank,
we cannot move without just cause.
Going directly against Schwartz is a
rather large risk.<>

You can be assured of a reward.  If I succeed
in my plans and become empress,
I shall aid the reconstruction of Crois.<>

What is your guarantee?  
You could, after becoming empress,
simply destroy Vermillion.<>

What impudence!<>

Unwetter!<>

Your Highness...<>

Do not call me as an Empress.  Not yet.
You are... Sir Unwetter?  I've heard what you have to 
say. We do not have much time and we need your help.
I shall promise that you will receive as you aid.<>

In a sense, you do not approve of the current
Imperial Family, just like us.  Someone like you
will rewrite the ruling I presume?
Though that will be a bloody path.<>

Such was the way of new rule since ancient times.<>

Excellent...  It is a deal.
A deal of such importance that it will 
change the world as we know it.<>

Before we go on...<>

I wish for an exhibition which displays your strenght.
Before we will take on Schwartz...<>

To make sure.<>

Well... impudence is not enough to describe this.
Mephisto, you are facing a ruler.<>
