What's this?  Come look at this,
is this the remaining Sion or something?<>

Maybe, thing looks pretty old.
Doesn't look all that great though.<>

Yeah it does.  It's got a nifty jewel and everything.
I think it could fetch some good coin.<>

With that moron, everything's about money.<>

Your point?  It's hard for me to just feed m'self.
Do you have even a clue what it's like?<>

It was pretty difficult before I was adopted.
Don't talk like you're the only one with problems.<>

These two always fight.<>

It would be more fun to watch if they started
betting which one is poorer.<>

Ugh... they really morons.<>

Like you know crap, besides when you were a kid...!<>

Don't you have anything besides
being poor to brad about?<>

I ain't taking no lip now!<>

Shut up, you ugly fruit!<>

What... what the hell?<>

Huh...!?<>

!?<>

Hm?  What happened?<>

Heheh, you turned into a real vegetable.
So this is magic?  Cool!<>

Hey! What did you do just now!?
Stop screwing around and fix this!<>

What do you want me to do?  I didn't do anything.
I don't even know what happened myself.<>

Don't give me that crap.  You used some weird magic.
Are you gonna stand there or are you gonna undo it?<>

But I really didn't...<>

Crush that armband.<>

Ehh?<>

It's the power of the Sion...<>

Hoo... I almost died.<>

Phew, that's better.<>

Bitch, you toyed with me.<>
Bitch, you toyed with me.

No no, it wasn't my fault.  It was the Sion.
Besides, you came back after I destroyed it.
A pumpkin suits you better anyway.<>

How did you know shattering the Sion would undo it?<>

Among Sions there are...
those that can change human appearance.
But I understand that to be pretty rare.<>

...<>

Adora...?<>

Calintz, about me, do you think...<>

Hmm...?<>

Nevermind.  We should go back.<>

...!<>
