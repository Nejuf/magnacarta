You're quite amazing, I'd expect nothing less.<>

I appreciate the compliment... but can we move out?$nI do not wish to stay here any longer.<>

Haha, even your personality is exactly as I was told.<>

Captain, I was worried about you.$nReally, why did you go off alone like that?<>

It's my duty as Captain to keep the$nmembers of my team safe.  Well, time to go.<>

Ow...!<>

Really, to waste your life like that...$nThese trolls are quite moronic.<>

You ok?<>

Well, it isn't exactly unusual to be$nattacked via guerilla warfare.<>

No, I mean... your arm... it looks like that hurts.<>

It's not unusual to have injuries,$nI'm alright, let's move out.<>
