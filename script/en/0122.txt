You have all done well.  His majesty would
grant appreciation for the work of Schwartz Storm.<>

I'm glad everything went well.<>

Thanks to what happened, Schwartz's situation
will improve.  This is great, wahaha.<>

Had there not been such a quick response 
from Squad 7, the ability to guard the
emperor would have been rendered moot.<>

Commander Wilhelmina, you seem to favor Squad 7.<>

Commander Loclei, for someone who aided the fake
empress, you should bite your tongue.  Were it not
for your nobility, your life would be forfeit.<>

That... that is...<>

I recognize that the seventh's movements were
unconventional.  However because of the
situation faced, the course they took
was more than acceptable.  Any other squad
would have done the same.<>

I will agree with that.<>

Thanks to our mission's success, her highness
has asked me to give special credence to the seventh
squad for their meritorious service.<>

...<>

Also, Commander Loclei, as punishment for your
failure, Squad 3 will not be allowed to
have visitors and permission to visit civilians
is revoked for the weekend.  Though we have
reason to believe that you were simply tricked,
you are still guilty of endangering the emperor's
safety by aiding the fake empress.<>

Yes... yes sir.<>

Very well.  You are all dismissed.  Go get some rest.<>

Her highness reminds me of Estell...
as if she had come back to life for me.<>

General, is something the matter?<>

Actually... I'm curious now.  Her highness is
supposedly from Elder.  In that case I want you
to find and summon her maids from Elder.
Do this with all haste.<>

Why would you want me to do that?<>

Don't question me, just do it.<>

Yes sir.<>

You should have been locked up, but
her highness is kind enough to let you 
go with such an easy mission.  
Do you understand what I'm saying?<>
