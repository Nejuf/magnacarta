Joker escaped...$nCalintz, have you been guarding him at all?<>

Hm...<>

I have a feeling that you let him go.<>

That fool brought Felicia to us.$nShouldn't there have been a token of appreciation?<>

You might just be the first I've$ncome across who has no regard for martial law.<>

I'll honor your discharge notice anytime.<>

That attitude keeps you here.<>

Sirat courts didn't welcome me either,$nbut Helios insisted that I stayed.$nWell, someone completely$nunrelated moved here in the end...<>

Joker has no place to go. Will Scaramouch take back a traitor like him?<>

It's not my concern, since he ran off on his own.<>

Can you at least take care of your unit?<>

It's not my job to babsit.<>

Touche.<>

This is quite the party; all the noblemen are here.$nI guess this invitation$nis out of genuine courtesy, however...$nWhat do you make of it, Willight?<>

Hm. Whether your highness will attend$nor not is up to you. I see no shortcoming in the party,$nespecially in that most of Ladrinne's$nfollowers will be there.$nSo it wouldn't be bad for your highness$nto make notes of them.<>

True. I never went to Ladrinne's gatherings,$nnot even her tea parties...<>

As a matter of fact,$nher highness has been hoping for your attendance.$nYour highness hasn't been to many meetings before.$nTo prevent acts of disgrace such as those of last time,$nhis highness gave permission to lend$nSchwartz Squad 7 as your guards.<>

Squad 7?$nThat's too much of a joke.$nHe gracefully grants peasants$nand commoners as my guard?$nI suppose I am fit for such,$nsince I am just countryside royalty.<>

That's not so, his highness gives these men his trust.$nThey may just have dumb luck,$nbut they can protect your highness.$nIt would have been possible for them to have$na higher rank if General Commander Gilbert$nagreed to do so.<>

Is that right?<>
