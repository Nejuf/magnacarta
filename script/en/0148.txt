I see. What you're saying is, our little relationship$nhere is temporarily under contract.<>

Looks that way.$nJoker knows where the hideout near Vermillion is.<>

Have you considered that this could be trickery?<>

I did.<>

If it's really a lie,$nI might even turn into a monster there.<>

By the same token,$nwe could find something to use in our favor.<>

I trust that you're skilled enough to avoid their trap,$nshould it turn out to be one.<>

You trust me too much.<>

I was transferred here due to demotion.<>

Referring to Ladrinne?<>

I thought I wouldn't see her when I came here.<>

But, she moved to Shudelmir right after I did.$nShe must enjoy harassing me, just for the hell of it.<>

I can see your anger.<>

Or maybe, anger coming from her, rather.<>

Hmm...$nIn any case, talk to Joker first.$nIt doesn't matter if he takes us to Vermillion or not,$nhe'll take responsibility afterwards.<>

I'll do it.<>
