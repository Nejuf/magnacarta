How were your first days at Elcritian?<>

I can say it's much better than Elder.$nWould I ever have a chance to even go$nsightseeing in such a gorgeous ball room?<>

Ohoho, you must excuse me for being rude.<>

That's not so, Orakhan.$nHis highness will be delighted to be here.<>

Is it time for Rose yet?<>

I believe so, any minute now.<>

...<>

What's the matter?<>

Orakhan, bad news.$nMonsters are outside...<>

What? Could it be Vermillion...!?<>

So Rose fell through fine.<>

There will be monsters here now.<>

Good job.<>

...?<>

Monsters outside... are Roffma and Felicia alright?<>

They'll be fine, they're not regulars.<>

Unspeakable...!<>
