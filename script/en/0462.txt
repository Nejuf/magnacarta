You're strong... nothing bad will happen,
with powers like yours. Stop with the runes though.
I want you to live a long, comfortable life...<>

Stay well. I can't leave my brothers.
They're in deep trouble because of me.
I need to help them.<>

It's good that you don't remember me, I suppose...
I'm not sure if we will meet again,
but that too might be fine...<>

...<>

Right. Well, be good.<>
