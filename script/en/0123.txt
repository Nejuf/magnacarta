Are you truly my sister...?<>

Yes, Your Majesty.$nFrom what I hear, there was a little disorder.$nI'm glad to see you well.<>

As a result, I could not greet you properly.$nPlease forgive me.<>

There is nothing to be forgiven.$nYour Highness did not have to trouble himself$nand greet a lowly woman such as myself.<>

Sis, don't say things like that.$nYou know how much I wanted to meet you.<>

You've... grown with a lot of care. <>

What do you mean?<>

Will you tell me about our father?$nI have such a foggy memory of my childhood,$nI can't even remember what he looked like.<>

Oh... sure sis. <>

Please pardon my rudeness but I am very tired$nfrom the long trip, I want to get some rest.<>

Oh... you're right.<>

He seems so radiant.. So different from myself,$nwho grew up in the shadows.$nHe's supposed to be... my only sibling.$nA sibling of mine whom our father gave so much love.<>
