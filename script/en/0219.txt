What are you dwelling on?
Did Calintz bother you that much?<>

Somehow... things are getting more
complicated without me realizing it.<>

What?<>

...<>

Anyway, just forget about it.  Though we
failed to assassinate Ladrinne, we made
a friend with our little empress.<>

It doesn't change the fact that we failed.<>

Wun Veto...<>

Excuse me for a moment, Rose?<>

Hm?  Ah... yes.<>

I fought with Calintz...
He's as strong as you've said.<>

I didn't intend to imply otherwise.<>

The servants I have sent to watch
Wun Veto have been slain...<>

Do you still insist on learning the truth?<>

Really... You... Are you truly Wun Veto?
If you have been alive for so long, why show yourself
now?  You seem different from your past self.<>

Then your orders... You do not care about the
purification of the runes by our enemies and you
stopped us from rescuing Felicia when she was
captured by Schwartz.
You call this loyalty to Vermillion?
Forgive me...!  Pardon my rudeness.<>

Trust my words Mephisto.
It has been too long since Vermillion's inception.
Meaningless fear will not be the future of Vermillion.<>
