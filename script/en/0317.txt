Calintz... is definitely Ropeidon's son. Helios knew that. I found out very late, but...<>

Father? Why didn't you... tell me? Why not before now...<>

I couldn't tell you. Helios told me that he himself had witnessed Calintz... killing his father, Ropeidon... so I couldn't tell you the truth. It would have been too shocking.<>

......Calintz, why did you...?<>

When Calintz was living in Shudelmir, he met a woman named Estell. She was a Vermillion spy trained by Ropeidon. Calintz probably developed a deep love for her as his mother, because he had no mother of his own.
But her mission was to marry King Clive as a concubine and eventually steal the imperial Emblem.<>

Ms. Adora, the Emblem you used to have originally belonged to Marhakatte, and that Emblem has the ability to overwrite other people's appearances and memories onto ordinary people. That's why you were dominated by the persona of Juclesia, which was sealed in the gemstone a long time.<>

Such power......<>

And the Emblem that Calintz has is of Krois, and it looks like he got it from his King Helios... It has similar abilities, but it's the most powerful of the four Emblems. This Emblem has the power to absorb the memories and emotions of those who come into contact. And according to the will of the person who has the Emblem, it has the ability to transfer it to another person or himself. Of course, memory manipulation is also possible.
In other words, my guess from hearing His Majesty Helios, is that Calintz was shocked to see his father killing Estell, his perceived mother, and unconsciously murdered his father. <>

Calintz terrified at what he had done, fled in fear, but eventually collapsed from exhaustion, and his Majesty Helios saved him. However Calintz had no memory of killing his father. Rather, he thought it was someone else that murdered his father. Perhaps... it could be said that Calintz passed his sin to someone else at his own will. In that case, he is himself in the end, but... <>

So Unwetter is Calintz?<>

The real Unwetter died at the hands of Calintz. Calintz unconsciously rejected his traumatic memories, and that's how he activated his Emblem and became a new personality. The Emblem absorbed Calintz's memories and sent the fake memories he desired. Whether it is a real memory or a fictional one, the Emblem absorbs it, and in some cases, releases it onto others. Had Calintz had more control of his Emblem, he would have been able to manipulate the memories and appearances of others to fit his will. Not to mention the other things he could have done.<>

...... So he could transfer memories onto other people?<>

You bet. <>

......<>

Commander, what can I do to get rid of the vile mind and bring him back to normal?<>

......Calintz, or rather is it Tristan? If we smash the Emblem, then Tristan disappears because he was born from the Emblem. No matter how strong Tristan is, he's still only part of Calintz's twisted memories.<>

Break the Emblem... it's simple.<>

It won't be so easy. Everyone... all of the weapons' Carta have disappeared. Tristan is plotting Magna Carta. In the old days, as Ropeidon did, he would try to destroy all sources of power. In other words, when Magna Carta begins, Shudelmir might disappear without a trace. Because Magna Carta was created originally as a forbidden ritual that evokes powers of destruction.<>

We have to stop it. They wouldn't have tried to stop us up until now if we were useless, right?<>

I can't deny it.<>

So now... <>

Stop Tristan. If you manage to stop Magna Carta, I won't ask you for anything in return. Miss Adora or even Calintz. Of course, Calintz should be returned to Sirat, ... or rather. Ladrinne, I'll leave it to you what to do with Calintz. Isn't he the son you thought was dead? <>

......I can't see him. I was so vicious towards him...<>

Still, you are a mother. You'll have to make it up to him by spending time with him in the future. If you turn your back on him, it means surrendering your qualifications as a mother. <>

It is said that Magna Carta is practiced in the Holy Land. North of Shudelmir. Please...return safely.<>
