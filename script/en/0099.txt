Hah, what are you doing there?<>

Can't you tell!? 
Don't just stand there, help me out!<>

You can bend your back more, 
why don't you? I couldn't care less.<>

I'll tell bro on you!<>

The hell? Y'all making fool of me!?<>

Are you all right?<>

Uh-huh... I'm OK. The squad leader though...<>

Did something happen to Gend?<>

Monsters were unexpectedly strong and large in 
numbers. We lost track of each other while fighting...<>

Ultimately the leader baited the 
strongest one to keep us safe,
but I don't know what happened after that.<>

We have to hurry, then.<>

Yeah... I'm coming with you. 
I can't just rest here without knowing 
whether our leader is safe or not.<>

Fine. On the condition that you guard yourself.
I can't afford to pay you mind.<>
