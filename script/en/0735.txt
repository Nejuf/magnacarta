After having my palm read, I couldn't think of anything else.$nA spy saw Estell, Your Majesty's attendant was$nseen sending messages to Vermillion.$nTo make matters worse,$nit was found that the attendant had been secretly$nraising a carrier pigeon...<>

Estell...<>

Some time later, Estell suddenly died.$nI knew the Court had sent an assassin...<>

I'm thinking of sending Juclecia to Elder.<>

Your Majesty... Why all of a sudden...?<>

She will eventually find out about Estell's demise,$nand she will want revenge on her mother's assailant.$nSo I'm going to save his life.<>

I see...<>

After that, Shurenlord became pregnant and$nI completely forgot about Juclecia.$nThe brightness in her eyes resembled$nher mother's, whom I cherished.$nThen one day, without anyone knowing,$na shabby carriage took her to the Elder.<>
