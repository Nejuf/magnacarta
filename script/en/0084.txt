These ruins are nothing but an abandoned home.
My childhood home.  With memories of her...<>

Estell...<>

This is amazing!  It's like another world!<>

Who are you?<>

Uh, I'm...<>

Well... ah, Adora!  Yeah, Adora.<>

Yeah, Adora.<>

How did you get in here?
This place is restricted.<>

I just... ended up here for some reason.  
There was a distinct smell of flowers...<>

(Who is she?  Maybe... Ladrinne's spy?)<>

What's your name?<>

What do you care?<>

Hmph, how stubborn.  
You could at least tell me your name.<>

Stop bothering me and get out.
I don't have time to babysit a kid like you.<>

What!  What part of me is a kid?<>

Heh...<>

Who the hell is this girl?<>

Did you fall in love with me at first sight?<>

What...?<>

She... resembles...<>

Having a good memory are we?<>

...?<>

I uh... I gotta go, but I like you, 
so we'll meet again.<>

I'll forget, so don't bother.<>

That's too much.<>

Well, in that case I'll make you remember.<>

Wait, what are you...<>

...<>

Hehe, now you can't forget me until next time.<>

Let's meet again!  Don't forget about me.  
Oh, you have to tell me your name next time!<>

...<>

That girl she... reminds me of Estell.<>
