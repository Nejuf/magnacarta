Another nice day.<>

Pretty exciting and thrilling times.
Is this all we do everyday?<>

Did you just realize that?<>

That's what Squad 7 does.<>

About time we get back home retards.
Stop acting like dumbasses with
your asinine conversations.<>

Adora?<>

I'll go now...<>

(Juclesia's about to move... They cannot find out.<>

...?<>

What's with her?<>

...<>

(This isn't how Adora usually is...
She used to disappear and reappear out of nowhere...
Now that I think on it, why didn't I follow her?
Did I subconsciously not want
to know where she was going?) <>

Hey, where are you going?<>

I'll see you at camp. I'm on to something.<>

What's with those two...?<>
