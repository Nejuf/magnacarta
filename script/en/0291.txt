We are all gathered. Then let's start talking.<>

Foremost, Schwartz Storm 7 Captain Calintz assassinated His Majesty Shurenlord and Her Majesty Leona tonight. There are also several witnesses. How would you explain this tragedy?<>

Of course... I am well aware, Your Majesty. <>

Calintz alone would never do such a reckless thing. As suggested, there must have been someone behind him.<>

That's why I'm being accused. It may sound rude, but... if you look at the situation alone, with the Queen and young prince gone, and the next successor to the throne becomes Your Majesty.<>

So, are you suggesting that I gave Calintz the assassination order? Indeed that is a deep insult, Sir Gilbert.<>

But it's also strange that Orakhan Gilbert would hire Calintz for that. Orakhan Gilbert was always loyal to His and Her Majesties. <>

But wasn't Schwartz Storm a private unit that moved according to Sir Gilbert's will, regardless of Your Majesty's will? It is also comprised of aristocrats from Bi-ere...<>

......<>

Admit it, Sir Gilbert. You were blinded by the imperial power and ordered their deaths. And... maybe your next target was me. Is that right!? <>

Now, Gilbert.  Let's clarify.<>

Gilbert is still an Orakhan. Please refrain from speaking rudely.<>

Calintz... what happened? Does you know what you did? Why do you have such a mesmerized face?<>

I don¡¯t have any excuses, and I¡¯m not sure what to think anymore.<>

......I honestly didn't want to do this, Your Majesty. You are the perfect princess herself, in my eyes. Even if it's a false life, if you're happy with it, I don't want to break your heart, or mine. <>

......?<>

But... there's no other choice. We can't overlook the deaths of Queen Leona and crown prince Shurenlord. <>

That, that's...!<>

When was it...? Did you steal it from my room? Sir Gilbert, are you insane? How dare you do that...!<>

......Please forgive me for revealing the truth, Your Majesty.<>

You succeeded, Gilbert...<>

Your Majesty...<>

...My, I...it's strange...my whole body...my whole body hurts...<>

You... then, that...?<>

...Oh, what happened? Juclesia... is gone. I'm fake. Why...?<>

......Adora.<>

Calintz...I...I...<>

This Emblem, which was given as a sign of loyalty to the first Orakhan, was thought to be a simple ancient relic, but in fact it is one of the tools to manipulate the human mind. Orakhan Willight, tell the truth. The real Princess Juclesia passed away from illness a long time ago. After that, you created a band to erase memories, and overwrite them with Juclesia's imperial appearance and memories through the power of this Emblem. All to make a puppet you control... <>

...How, how...?<>

Long ago, I heard the news that Her Majesty Juclesia had passed away, and was puzzled when I later learned that she was still alive. So I did my own research.<>

Whoo... Orakhan Willight, you're already trapped. You had us all fooled with your fake princess. Now we know your puppet play.<>

Oh no. I...I...!<>

Well, you tried to destroy us. And Calintz, I gave you a chance to grow up in Schwartz and you disappointed me. Were you colluding with Marhakatte?...and having this girl always with you was a part of the vile plot, wasn't it?<>

I...I...<>

Ladrinne, Calintz seems to know nothing...If he did, he wouldn't have handled it this poorly.<>

Gilbert, because of this guy, I almost framed you... but do you think there is still room for sympathy? <>

Calintz... I... I didn't do anything...<>

What the hell... what happened? You and I...both...<>

Today I lost my only brother and my mother. You know how grieving I am, right?<>
