I could not protect...<>

I looked straight at her...
and still I didn't protect...<>

Somehow... I think she'll show up again,
just like Estell.<>

You're a boy and you still wear wristbands?<>

It's not like that.
This is something mother left
to me before she died.<>

Oh... sorry. I didn't know.<>

...<>

Your mother passed away?<>

She died giving birth to me. My father told me.<>

I see. You wouldn't know what
your mom looked like then.<>

There's no way I could know...<>

Sorry. I tell you things that don't make sense.<>

Father doesn't like talking about her.
I guess they weren't very close.<>

...<>
