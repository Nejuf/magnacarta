Guh...<>

It's... over.<>

Ke.. kehehe.. Over you say?
What babble. Magna Carta has already begun.<>

What...?<>

Watch carefully,
the funeral of Shudelmir.<>

No way... that's...<>

Magna Carta cannot be stopped.<>

...<>

So you want to meet Calintz so badly? 
I possess his body, I can turn into 
him and you can watch him die.<>

What I want is the true Calintz,
not some fake image of him.<>

He's dead.<>

No... you were created by that Emblem.
If it disappears... so will you.<>

...!<>

You want to meet Calintz. Did you forget that already?
Just as myself, you are but a ghost, created in place
of Estell. You can hide under the name Adora all
you want, but you're nothing more than a copy.<>

...<>

Do you understand?
If the Emblem is shattered, you too will pass away.<>

...<>

Don't you want Calintz?
It will mean nothing if you disappear.<>

Calintz... I wanted to see you one last time,
before I go. I guess that won't happen, huh?<>

It's funny. I only wanted to see you again.
I was kind of hoping I could...
I guess that's too much to ask.<>

Why... are there things that can never
occur in this world? Why... can I not tell you
what I have in my mind? Why... I truly feel that
I like you, how can this be a lie?<>

Really, I want to... 
meet you so badly...
so badly... why can't I?<>

Sorry... Calintz.<>

Adora...<>
