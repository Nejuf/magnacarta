Everyone seems to be here... 
I will now start the discussion 
without beating around the bush, 
we don't have much time.<>

Soon, Her highness, 
Imperial Princess Juclecia 
will return to the throne. 
You probably already know, 
but her highness has stayed 
in Elder due to her weak health. 
However, she is now well, and
furthermore His Majesty wishes
solace for his sister, writing 
her a letter saying that he 
himself wishes for her coming.<>

For the time being, Schwartz Storm, 
along with royal guards, is to guard his majesty's. 
His highness desires to greet the imperial princess 
in person, thus the reunion will
occur in the Forest of Jaklinde.<>

It's difficult to call Jaklinde Forest a safe place... 
We need to be alert for any possible accidents.<>

Well, there ARE a lot of monsters there lately, 
but in that case, why not clear
out the forest beforehand?<>

Don't speak of such idiocy. 
Monsters are not the problem we face.<>

This is a chance too excellent 
for Vermillion to let go.<>

Oh, yeah...
Well, I knew about that... 
Obviously.<>

Preparing for a possible attack, 
we planned Schwartz Storm to be
divided and be positioned in the forest.
First, squad one and two will guard the area
near his highness. Squad three will wait for
the imperial princess in front of the entrance,
and guide her to his highness.<>

Keep your guard up, all of you.
Our first and foremost priority is to
secure safety of his majesty, do not forget that.<>

The fifth squad will wait at the exit of the forest 
which will lead to the castle. Squad six will be
on standby in the western part of the forest,
while seven stands by in the eastern part. 
As for us, our job is communication among 
other teams and patrolling individually throughout.<>
