Help!  Save me... ah...!<>

Gurgh... mmph... Father... Let go... mmph...<>

I did not call out then.  No, I could not.<>

Hey.<>

...<>

This is dangerous, even if we're talking
about Schwartz.  Vermillion is problematic enough.<>

...<>

I'm fine.  "No problem for Scaramouche scum..."
but I'm probably not one to say that, haha.
Grgh... heh.  I was a little surprised,
to be honest.  They're probably mad too.
They knew that Scaramouche would end.<>

...!<>

It's not serious, don't worry.<>

Are you all right...?<>

Why didn't you... call me that day?<>

...<>

I would have come if you called.<>

Your father... wanted to keep you safe.<>

That's not the problem.<>

If that happened...
You would become...
A Sion Channeler as well.
You are... one of their targets.<>

...<>

It's fine...
I'm becoming my old self again.<>

Yeah...
That's the way to go.  You were always
quite a tomboy.  I think I can only
remember getting my butt kicked by you.<>

...<>

Joking...
Just joking...<>

...<>

Back so soon.<>
