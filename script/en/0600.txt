Huh...!<>

Ugh... that dream again.<>

It's already dawn.<>

It's already been ten years since that day
I never want to remember.  I'd never imagined it
would take me so long to return here, this land
which holds so many memories.  This land which
holds an even greater pain... Shudelmir.<>
