This is pretty.
Is it really something I can have?<>

That's the only thing my mother left to me...
She died giving birth to me.  My father
gave that wristband to me.<>

Really?  If it's that precious then...<>

No, it's fine.  It's not exactly like
I wish to be called weird for wearing a
woman's wristband, heh.  And...<>

...?<>

I wanted to give it to someone I like...<>

About last time... I'm sorry.
I'm not good when it comes to talking
with others about bad things.<>

I thought I'd never see you again, because Calintz
you were like, so angry.  I thought I'd give you
a hard time if I showed up.  And I thought about that.
Why I'm attracted to you, really.  It's not like you
hide what I need to remember.<>

...<>

But I had no answer.  I don't know, I just
continue to think that I'm familiar with you.
The more time we spend together, the more I wonder,
is it ok to appear in front of you all the time?
I get scared the closer we get.  I'm not sure
if this is actually okay.<>

I don't know either...
But I know if you're not there...
I feel empty.<>

Eh...?<>

I think I've gotten used to the
retarded things that you do.<>

Can I come and bug you then Calintz...?<>

Bug me?<>

Er, I mean, you know, hang out and stuff.<>

I thought you were being serious just now...<>

I'm glad you understand.<>

...<>

I... could this be some part of myself
searching for Estell?  Is it why I see Adora?
Could be... I suppose if there's someone
who will let me forget her it's...<>
