Chelsea, I don't wish to hear any more of this.
She was clearly acting in consort with
Rose of Vermillion and furthermore, she
followed Rose's orders.  There is nothing more
to talk about.  Just before, Orakan Willight
bothered me and now you, Chelsea.  When will
everyone stop bothering me?  I'm exhausted
enough as it is, I merely wish to rest now.<>

Orakan, Adora is not affiliated with Vermillion.
She just isn't that kind of person...
she's little more than a child.
I merely assume that Rose took
advantage of her naivety.<>

You say you know her so well, yet you do not
know where she is from, nor her origins?
You will need more evidence than that
if you are to defend her.<>

...<>

Come in.<>

Haha.  So you will be the third lawyer?<>

I've listened to the situation, Orakan...<>

Is that so?
What excuses do you bring for Adora's actions?<>

I won't give you any excuses.  Let her go for me.
She is not affiliated with Vermillion.  I warned
her earlier, but she was caught in the mess
because she was following me.<>

What exactly is your relationship with her?<>

She's my... girlfriend.<>

What?  Ahahahah.  This is too much.
Your girlfriend you say... you're kidding right?<>

It is the truth... She likes to follow me,
and she's someone precious to me.  She probably
doesn't even know she was used, because
she is originally of common lineage
and doesn't know much.<>

So that's your type is it?  Quite a pair I'll say.
After moving to Shudelmir they say you fooled around
like a cat in heat and I suppose that was true?
That girl is so common that even her origin
isn't on the record, of course you would hang
around the likes of her... I suppose that's
your forte though... to know where you belong.<>

Orakan...!<>

The life of a common peasant is worth nothing
to you.  It would be like letting go of a bug.
I ask you to let go of her.<>

That's not the way to ask someone for a favor,
Calintz.  I've been giving you my advice since
your days in Sirat.  I don't like your attitude.
Do you think you are royalty?  Act according
to your origins, honey.<>

...<>

I don't think you understand me.  Get on your knees
and beg.  You should be bowing on the floor and that
might be barely enough.  I never had any intention
of letting go that witch called Adora...
or whatever her name is.<>

Now you should consider, Orak...<>

I beg you Orakan, please let Adora live.<>

Hmph, what name?  Calintz?
Father brought you here, eh?
What was he thinking?  He must enjoy
bringing bums from the street who
have no legitimate background.<>

I suppose you clowned your way into
royal prestige?  You shameless wimp...!<>

I knew I was an eyesore to this woman from
the beginning... although one of these days,
I wanted to be recognized by her.  I looked for
the warmth of Estell in Ladrinne when I first
moved into the castle and was desperately lonely.<>

"My only, precious son.  You will take after
the Sirat bloodlines, Raziel.  Your nobility
is affirmed.  So you shouldn't play with
someone like Calintz.  His kind is lower than
a dog, as I have told you."<>

For someone who can mutter such...
what can I ask for?<>

I suppose you are correct in that her life is
likened to a bug.  It will not matter whether
she dies.  I will overlook this case since you
actually begged for her life.  Though she was
not the only one to ruin this dance... it would
be wise of you to remember the part she took in it.<>

You will let her go?<>

Ahahahaha, to the the great Calintz beg...
There's a first time for everything.
Of course, since you begged so miserably,
like a scared child, your knees trembling,
I would seem inconsiderate if I didn't grant
you some solace.  Take her with you.<>

(Yeah... just kill me now.<>
