It's been a long time,
Ambassador Plenipotentiary, Orakhan.<>

Hooo? You actually came to greet me? How unusual.<>

Don't misunderstand me,
I'm just doing it to be polite.<>

What candor.  Are you here for your assignment?
It won't be as cooshy as the Imperial Guards.<>

I don't have any big expectations.<>

Good, you should be quite comfortable in Squad Seven.
It's full of peasant scum like you.<>

(Ladrinne Morei Rune Sirat, the Sirat kingdom's only
ranking woman. She's my sister-in-law but there's no
blood shared between us. She's obsessed with the
notion of getting Prince Crois into power.)<>

Quite a venemous tongue you've developed, eh?<>

You bastard. You need to learn some manners.<>

Do you think I wanted to see you, Ambassador?
I never really gave a shit about the throne of such
a small kingdom, the only reason I'm in line is
because Emperor Helios adopted me.<>

You're so conceited. You have no right to the throne.
Yet you're using your father as a shield, and you
dare to call yourself royalty?<>

I agree.<>

Really... one day I'll see you on your knees.<>

(Emperor Helios is her father, and my adopted father
as well. It's been 12 years since he first took me in.
I was raised in the Sirat Kingdom.)<>

That's enough for now.
Shouldn't you be leaving, "Captain Calintz?"<>
