Been a while since you've joined us.
Getting used to Schwartz yet?<>

I guess. Nowadays we don't have duties,
I was about to get some booze.<>

Good then. We've recently discovered some ruins.
They've got Sion, of course. I don't think there
have been any Vermillion Rune transfers there.<>

By that I mean not yet. We could face Vermillion
any time, so go purify the Sion there.<>

No problem.<>

You don't look too well nowadays.
Are you sleeping well?<>

It's your duty as well, to stay healthy.
It'd be difficult if you were tired
when we needed you.<>

Urk... I know.<>

The general was right. I rested more than usual,
since I didn't have anything to take care of.
Oddly enough, I felt tired all day.<>

Moreover, sometimes I felt as if my 
body was cold after waking up.
Like I took a walk outside in the cold.<>
