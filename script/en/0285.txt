I don't know if Roffma will be okay. He didn't say anything... Besides, where could have happened to the leader...<>

Leave it alone. You'll feel better if you just let it go.<>

The leader, even if he turned into a monster, it was probably because he was hesitant to strike down Roffma's brother. I wonder if the situation would have changed a little if the order of closure had not been issued.<>

You know... I'm sorry, but in some ways, it might have been better to issue an order of closure. <>

But...<>

Sacrificing a cow for your own good... is a natural thing in a way. It's common practice in Vermillion. But this time it's a little different. It's as if the people were sacrificed instead of Schwartz.<>

Yes... at least Schwartz made that choice. No matter how much I look at, it seems that Schwartz's life and the lives of the commonfolk are not comparable.<>
