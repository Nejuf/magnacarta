Schwartz Storm Headquarters - Conference Room<>

This is the conference room where the leaders of Schwartz Storm gather. A number of important issues are decided here.<>

The fortress is mainly focused on purifying Sions. They're a type of gemstone mainly found in ruins. They're very dangerous objects because they contain a lot of Carta.<>

Vermillion is producing Sion Channelers, who can amplify the power of the Sion stones, which causes the Carta within a human or animal's body to turn them into monsters.  They also use them to manipulate a person's will and control their mind. We must quickly purify the stones that have spread all over the continent...<>

Captain Wilhelmina is the leader of our Squad 4 which is primarily responsible for information gathering and analysis. She holds a lot of trust from Captain Gilbert. She's sober and absolutely unshakable... it's unbelievable that she's a woman. <>

In addition, Captain Wilhelmina has excellent sword skills. She says she rarely enters into battle, but... it was amazing to watch her spar with Captain Drake. Everyone was surprised!<>

I also heard that Captain Calintz is very strong. You have the nickname Phantom of Avalanche, right? I'm curious to know how good you are... to earn such a fearful name.<>
