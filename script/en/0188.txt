Joker no longer belongs to Vermillion.$nForget your childhood.$nYou remember who his father is, don't you?<>

Yes...<>

I didn't think you would make such a mistake.$nDid you plan to get work done using Joker?<>

Felicia will return... you have my word.<>

We do not have enough power to fight against Schwartz.$nHow do you plan to rescue her? Drop your ego and$nstart paying attention to the missions you already have.<>

...<>

If things go smoothly here,$neven Unwetter will recognize you.$nSomehow... he looks the same as he was in the past,$nbut his soul is somehow different.<>

Ferenan...?<>

Nothing.  Nevermind. Honestly I'm relieved that he came.$nWise men like him will lead us to what we wish to be...$nJust as he saved Vermillion in the past.<>

That face he has, his smile seems to tell you he knows...$neveryone thinks of Unwetter as$nthe return of some messiah, but...<>
