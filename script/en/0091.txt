This place is nothing but ruins now...
but it's where I spent my childhood.
The place of my memories with Estell...<>

Estell...<>

Amazing! This place seems like another world!<>

Who are you?<>

Uh, me? I'm...<>

Uh... I'm Adora... Yeah, I'm Adora!<>

How did you get in here? This place is off-limits.<>

I just... Came in here for some reason.
I liked the smell of the flowers too...<>

(Is she... Ladrinne's spy?)<>

What's your name?<>

What do you care?<>

Come on, it's just a name.<>

Stop bothering me and get out.
I have no time for a brat like you.<>

Brat? I have everything that I need to have!<>

Ugh...<>

Who is this kid...<>

Hehe, you have a crush on me, right?<>

What!?<>

Somehow you... You remind me of someone.<>

Estell? That's a weird name.<>

What? You arrogant brat. 
You are just like your father.<>

Brat? I'm Calintz.<>

Calintz? That's a brat's name.<>

Hmph, you old people are all the same.<>

O... Old!?<>

Ow... Owch! That hurts! Stop it!<>

If you call me old again I'm going
to pull out all your hair!
Tomorrow I'll teach you how to treat a lady.<>

Okay okay, just let me go!<>

Hm... a funny memory.<>

...?<>

Oh, I... I gotta go, but I like you
so I'll be back to see you again.<>

Well, I'll probably forget about you so don't bother.<>

Aww...<>

Hey, what are you...<>

...<>

Hehe, you won't forget me now, right?<>

See you later then. Don't forget about me!
The next time we meet, tell me your name.<>

Damn... I won't be able to forget that until I die.<>

She... kinda reminds me of Estell.<>

It should be around here somewhere...<>

It was here... a picture of my family was hanging on
this wall. I can barely remember now but it's gone.
All the valuables in the house were probably sold
somewhere when the house burnt down. Or stolen...<>

Now... I can't even remember my own parents anymore.<>

Ok, Adora.<>

Hm... Fine, I'll make you remember.<>
