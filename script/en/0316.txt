Gh... this the first...
first time I've fought someone strong like him...<>

This... this has to be Calintz.<>

What nonsense are you talking about?<>

I'm sure.
Calintz wouldn't let anyone take his necklaces...<>

You mean...<>

Orakan Ladrinne.<>

Have you seen... Ropeiden?<>

Ropeiden? You mean Unwetter? He left.<>

Left...?<>

What happened here? What about Calintz...?<>

Ropeiden... No, he can't be Ropeiden.
That Unwetter, however, is Calintz.
I couldn't believe my eyes.
Calintz turned into him before my eyes.<>

Calintz...<>

You... where did you get that wristband?<>

This... Calintz gave me this.
He told me that it was from his mother...<>

This cannot be. This was a treasure of
Sirat royalty. I gave this to Ropeiden when
I became the heir... then, Calintz is...<>

...!<>

No, let go! I'll die here! My baby, my baby,
where is here? I didn't find him!<>

Please... I beg of you. You must live on.
Krois is facing the end. It's the request
of his highness Helios, so please...<>

Father... how could father...
what about when he made me marry the Krois prince,
and now he wants to destroy Krois, just because
the Emperor wants him to?
He uses his daughter like a tool...!<>

My apologies, your highness. We must go.
Helios tried to save Ladrinne by begging
the Emperor. So please...<>

No, let me go! Ropeiden...! Ropeiden, where are you?
My baby...! Tristan...! Tristan!!!<>

Calintz... Tristan... he's Tristan?<>

I... what have I done...<>

You're all here... I've heard the story.<>

Gilbert, I've done something terrible.
To Calintz, to the boy...<>

So then, what do you know about it? My father...
I gues he is like a savior to you. For me,
he's a sworn enemy. My husband, my son...
Whom do you think is responsible for their deaths?<>

Why was I... left alive?
Why did you turn me into a filthy woman!?
If only he was alive...
If only my son was alive...
I wouldn't have become like this!<>
