Why are you with us, all of a sudden?
Now that we're on the run, you want to use us, right?
Is that it?<>

...<>

You're responsible for destroying my home and family.<>

I too... regret that incident.<>

It already happened.
I'm not here to listen to your petty excuses.<>

There was a point when Vermillion changed.
When they became a group that resorted to extreme
means of terrorism.  The trend became even worse
when Wun Veto appeared.  I felt something was wrong,
but it was too late by the time I realized it.<>

Ferenan...<>

I... I won't follow Wun Veto anymore.
Being a coward, attacking Evell...
I will not rebuild Crois if it means forsaking
my honor. I'll quit... I'll find some other way.<>

Wun Veto was your mentor...<>

Wun Veto is different now...<>

He is... extreme.<>

What does that mean?<>

I don't know...
But... there's something deceitful in his eyes.<>

What kind of...?<>

Yeah, I guess that best describes how I felt.
Somehow he is like Wun Veto... and yet not.
After he came, I seemed to just move according to
his orders.  I didn't even realize what I was doing.<>
