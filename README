This archive is a collection of the tools I have written during the course of
the Magna Carta translation. It was some of the first programming work I ever
did for a translation so it's a bit messy in places.

Prior to Magna Carta, virtually every translation need I ever had could be
answered by a hex editor or some existing tool, it was the first time I really
had no choice but to write my own series of tools.

fpb2txt - converts fpb files to txt files (aka, dumps the script)
txt2fpb - converts the Korean EUC text scripts I released to game compatable
          fpb format (does not support auto-formatting, $n is treated as a
	  line break)
texcvrt - converts all the Magna Carta textures to graphics editable with
          Adobe Photoshop (removes SOFTMAX headers and analyzes the file to
	  determine what format it is in and assigns the proper extension)
